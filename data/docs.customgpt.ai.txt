TL;DR: Don't like reading documentation? Jump straight into our
cookbooks
on GitHub.
This quickstart guide aims to facilitate the process of getting you prepared for your first API call. If you are looking for our application, visit
https://app.customgpt.ai/
If you would like to get more in-depth with our API, visit our
API Reference
.
Step 1: Create an Account or Log In
To use the CustomGPT website and API, you'll need to sign up for an account.
Sign up or log in
here
.
For more information, see our
guide
on creating an account and logging in.
üîí
Shhh!
It is important to keep your password private and not share it with anyone.
Step 2: Acquiring the API key
From
the app
, click on the circle in the top right corner of the project dashboard and select the
"My Profile"
option from the dropdown menu that appears.
Select the
API
tab and press the
Create API Key
button to generate a new API key.
üöß
Warning
Make sure to take note of this key when it is created, as you will not get a chance to see it again without deleting it and creating a new key.
Please ensure to keep your API key secure and confidential to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
Step 3: Making the first API call
Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. To authenticate with CustomGPT API endpoints, you must provide the API Key in the header, as shown below.
Authentication Header
'authorization: Bearer Your_API_KEY'
For example, you will use the
POST - Create new project
endpoint to create a new project. In this scenario, you can send an API request by adding your API Key in the Authentication header and the sitemap you wish to use as a data source in the sitemap_path as shown below:
cURL
curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://app.customgpt.ai/api/v1/projects' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer Your_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "project_name": "Test",
  "sitemap_path": "https://example.com/sitemap.xml"
}
'

How CustomGPT.ai Builds AI Agent from My Website?
CustomGPT.ai offers an easy way to build an AI Agent by crawling and indexing content directly from your website. Follow these steps to create a project using your website's content.
Suggest Edits
Step 1: Create a New Agent
a) Log in to your CustomGPT.ai account.
b) Click on '
New Agent
' in the dashboard.
c) Choose '
Website
' as your content source.
Step 2: Provide Your Website‚Äôs Domain
a) "
Enter a URL or a sitemap
" in the provided field.
b) Click on
"Create Agent"
to start building your AI Agent using the detected pages from the website
Step 3: Sitemap Search
a) CustomGPT.ai will first attempt to find a sitemap for the domain you provided. If a sitemap is found, CustomGPT.ai will crawl the pages listed on the sitemap, indexing the content for your AI agent.
Step 4: If No Sitemap is Found
a) If a sitemap is not found, CustomGPT.ai will:
Attempt to find all links on your website's main page and crawl them.
Find links on the new pages discovered and crawl those as well.
Continue this process until it reaches your per-agent page limit or no new links are found.
üöß
If no links are found, CustomGPT.ai will crawl and index just the single page you provided.
Same-Domain Crawling Only:
a) In the case sitemap was not present, CustomGPT.ai will only crawl links we find that remain within the same domain. For example: If your domain is
https://customgpt.ai
, links like
https://google.com
or even
https://docs.customgpt.ai
will not be crawled.
üëç
Congratulations! You‚Äôve successfully created an AI agent from your website content using CustomGPT.ai!

How CustomGPT.ai Usage Limits Work
Your CustomGPT.ai account and agents are subject to specific usage limits. This article provides an overview to help you understand these limits better.
Suggest Edits
Account Limits
Two types of limits affect your account: general limits and monthly limits.
You can view current usage for all general and monthly limits on the Dashboard and the Limits and Usage page, where a daily breakdown is also available.
General Limits
üöß
If you reach any of the general limits, you can either delete some content to free up space or
contact our sales team
to increase your limits.
Team Members
Determines the number of people you can add to your CustomGPT.ai team.
Standard plan:
Up to 3 team members, including yourself.
Premium plan:
Up to 5 team members, including yourself.
Agents
Determines how many active CustomGPT.ai agents (agents) you can have simultaneously.
Standard plan:
Up to 10 active agents.
Premium plan:
Up to 100 active agents.
Words Stored
Determines the amount of context material you can store in our system.
Standard plan:
Up to 60 million words.
Premium plan:
Up to 300 million words.
This limit is shared across all agents. If you reach this limit, existing agent functionality will remain unaffected, but you won't be able to add new context material. You also won‚Äôt be able to add context material to any new agents created after reaching the limit.
Keep in mind that our system uses tokens instead of words, as all AI models operate on this principle. This means our word limits are actually token limits. On average, one word in English is about
1.3 tokens
. We use this number for approximation, but it can vary depending on the word and its length. Consequently, the word count displayed next to your documents may differ slightly from the actual count.
Monthly Limits
These limits control monthly system usage and reset each month based on your billing period. The reset date can be found on the Limits and Usage page.
üöß
If you reach any of the monthly limits, your account may not function normally until the next cycle. For increased access sooner, please
contact our sales team
.
Queries
The number of queries your agents can respond to each month.
Standard plan:
1,000 queries per month.
Premium plan:
5,000 queries per month.
If this limit is reached, all your agents will stop responding to user queries.
Documents Indexed
The number of documents you can index monthly across all agents.
Standard plan:
Up to 10,000 documents per month.
Premium plan:
Up to 40,000 documents per month.
If you reach this limit, you won‚Äôt be able to index new documents until the next monthly cycle, even if individual agents haven‚Äôt reached their document limits.
In our system, a document refers to a single data source used by your agent. This could be a document, such as a PDF or DOCX file, a page of a website, YouTube video, or any other file or document that contributes to your agent's context material.
Words Processed
The number of words of context material you can process through our system each month across all agents.
Standard plan: Up to 120 million words per month.
Premium plan: Up to 600 million words per month.
If this limit is reached, you won‚Äôt be able to process new words until the next cycle, even if there‚Äôs remaining space on your Words Stored limit.
‚ùóÔ∏è
Be cautious with the auto-sync feature, as it can quickly consume your monthly Items Indexed and Words Processed limits!
Agent Limits
Individual agents are limited only by the total number of documentss allowed per agent.
Standard plan:
Up to 5,000 documentss per agent.
Premium plan:
Up to 20,000 documentss per agent.
Agents are also bound by your general usage limits, as reaching these limits affects all agents' functionality.

Suggest Edits
Step 1: Sign in
a) Sign in to
https://app.customgpt.ai/
.
Step 2: Navigate to AI Agent Settings
a) Click on "
AI Agent tab
".
Step 3: Access AI Agent
a) Go to "
Citation
."
Step 4: Choose Response Source
a) Locate the "
Response source
" section.
b) Click on the "
Response source
" drop-down menu.
c) Choose the desired response source option by clicking on it.
"Default" or "Your Content" restricts usage to only your data with a rock-solid boundary to prevent ChatGPT from hallucinating (aka making things up). However, choosing "Your Content + ChatGPT" allows access to the general ChatGPT knowledge base as well.
Step 5: Save Changes
a) Click on "
Save Changes
".

Congratulations! You have successfully changed the Response Source for your AI Agent. This configuration allows you to control where your AI Agent derives its responses from, giving you flexibility in tailoring the content to your needs and preferences ‚úî

How Complex Tasks Works
The agent breaks down user queries into five sub-queries, isolating key components to better understand the user's intent.
A vector database is queried for each sub-query individually to retrieve the most relevant data.
The retrieved contexts are merged into one, providing comprehensive insights.
This process adds a slight latency of 1-2 seconds due to the enhanced processing.
When to Use:
Best suited for complex, multi-dimensional queries where advanced insights are required.
Ideal for projects where the system needs to anticipate user needs and provide in-depth responses.
Avoid enabling for simple queries, as it might add unnecessary latency without significant benefits.
Key Benefits of Complex Tasks
Enhanced Understanding:
The agent can handle multi-dimensional queries by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts.
Improved Response Quality:
Merging results from sub-queries ensures the response is thorough and contextually relevant.
Forward-Thinking AI:
Anticipates user needs, delivering insights beyond the immediate query.

How to Use Fast Responses Mode for Your AI Agent
Speed up your AI Agent‚Äôs responses using Fast Responses Mode, designed for users who prioritize response time without significantly sacrificing quality.
Suggest Edits
What is Fast Responses Mode?
Fast Responses Mode uses a more efficient version of GPT-4o, known as GPT-4o-mini, alongside speed optimizations. While the response quality might be slightly lower than other models, the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology ensures that relevant information is still gathered from your database. This mode is perfect for agents where faster response times are crucial.
How to Access Fast Responses Mode:
Step 1: Sign In
a) Sign in to
https://app.customgpt.ai/
.
Step 2: Navigate to AI Agent Settings
a) Click on "
AI Agent Settings
".
Step 3: Access AI Intelligence Settings
a) Within AI Agent Settings, click on "
AI Intelligence Settings
".
b) Click on "
Fastest Responses
" to enable this feature for your agent.
Step 4: Customize Response Generation
a) Scroll down to the "
Generate Responses From
" section in the Intelligence tab.
b) Select the preferred response source:
My Data Only (Recommended):
The AI uses only your uploaded content for responses.
My Data + LLM:
The AI combines your data with its general knowledge base to generate more creative and diverse responses.
b) After configuring the desired options (e.g., enabling Complex Tasks and customizing responses), scroll to the bottom of the page. Click on the "
Save Settings
" button to apply your changes.
üëç
Congratulations! You've successfully enabled Fast Responses Mode, allowing your AI Agent to deliver faster replies while maintaining relevant results. ‚úÖ

Suggest Edits
Step 1: Navigate to Agent Access
Click on "
Agent Access
"
üìò
Only workspace administrators can invite AI Agents to channels
Step 2: Select Agent
Admins need to first select the desired agent from the agent list.
Step 3: Select Individual Users
Admins can then select individual users who will have access to the selected agent. Selected users can add that agent to any channel they want, even if they are not admins.
üìò
By default, only admins can invite AI agents to channels unless specific users are selected.
Step 4: Enable Public Access
If the "Yes" option is checked, any user can add the agent to their channels without admin selection.
üìò
By default, no users are selected, meaning only admins can invite AI agents to channels unless permissions are adjusted.

Example: Before & After
First, I notice that the metadata for this source doesn't look and act how I want.
Second, I open the metadata editor to see the current setup.
Third, I change and save the metadata to reflect how I want it to look. Here are my changes:
Title:
Cut out unnecessary text.
URL:
Now links to the main API reference page.
Image URL:
Using icon of a book instead of CustomGPT.ai logo.
Description:
Edited to be more concise.
(
NOTE:
see how the preview field underneath 'Page / Metadata' changes to reflect the updates)
Lastly, I check the output to make sure my source looks and acts how I want.
üìò
PRO TIP: increase your conversions by changing the URL of paywalled uploads to link back to your payment page ‚úî

How to Enable and Use CRM Integration for Your Agent
This guide will walk you through the steps to enable and effectively use the CRM Integration feature for your CustomGPT.ai agent.
Suggest Edits
What It Does
The CRM Integration feature allows you to pass a unique identifier from your CRM system, or any other source, into our platform. This identifier will be linked to conversations and will be visible in analytics and log exports, offering deeper insights into user interactions.
How to Enable CRM Integration
Step 1: Sign in
a) Sign in to
https://app.customgpt.ai/
.
Step 2: Deploy Agent
a) Click the
Deploy Agent
icon.
b) Locate the "
Make Public
" button and click it.
Step 3: Go to Deployment Options
a) Navigate to any of the supported deployment options (Embed, Live Chat, Website Copilot, Search Generative Experience, Instant Viewer).
Step 4: Go to Settings
a) Locate the "
Settings
" icon for deployment type you want to use.
Step 5: Enable CRM Integration
a) Turn on the CRM Integration toggle. This feature allows you to pass a user identifier from your CRM system (e.g., a customer‚Äôs email or ID) to our platform. This identifier will be connected with the conversation and visible in analytics and logs.
‚ùóÔ∏è
Important: Simply turning the feature on is not enough, as it will not work without updating the code snippet on your website.
Step 6: Update the Code Snippet
Next you need to add this parameter to the code snippet:
external_id="value"
Value will normally be a variable from your external system which you want to associate with CustomGPT.ai prompts.
Example usage:
<div id="customgpt_chat"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.customgpt.ai/js/embed.js"
defer
div_id="customgpt_chat"
p_id="123456"
p_key="abcdefgh"
external_id="123456"></script>
üöß
Note: Replace the values of p_id, p_key, and external_id with your specific agent ID, key, and desired value. You will need to handle the variable assignments on your own.
How to Disable CRM Integration
You can disable the CRM Integration feature in two ways:
a) Turn the Toggle Off
Disabling the toggle will stop the integration, even if
external_id=""
is still present in your code snippet.
b) Remove the Code Snippet
Remove the
external_id=""
parameter from the code snippet deployed on your website.
‚ùóÔ∏è
Important: Data already stored will remain accessible even after the feature is disabled.
How to Access CRM-Linked Data
a) Data linked with CRM integration is currently accessible through the following exports:
Analytics > User Feedback
Ask Me Anything > Export Conversations
üëç
Congratulations! You've successfully enabled and set up CRM Integration for your CustomGPT.ai agent. Now, you can connect user conversations with CRM data, providing valuable insights for your business.

How to Enable and Use Pre-Prompt for Your Agent
This guide will help you enable the Pre-Prompt feature for your CustomGPT.ai agent, allowing your AI Agent to automatically trigger the first response as soon as the conversation is opened.
Suggest Edits
What It Does
The Pre-Prompt feature automatically sends the initial prompt as soon as the conversation is opened.
How to Enable Pre-Prompt
Step 1: Sign in
a) Sign in to
https://app.customgpt.ai/
.
Step 2: Deploy Agent
a) Click the
Deploy Agent
icon.
b) Locate the "
Make Public
" button and click it.
Step 3: Go to Deployment Options
a) Navigate to any of the supported deployment options (Embed, Live Chat, Website Copilot, Instant Viewer). Due to it's nature, Pre-Prompt is not available for Search Generative Experience deployment option.
Step 4: Scroll to Expert Mode
a) Locate the "
Setting
" icon.
Step 5: Enable Pre-Prompt Integration
a) Turn on the Pre-Prompt Integration. This feature triggers the first message to the AI Agent as soon as the conversation is opened. For example, you could push form submissions as the initial message.
‚ùóÔ∏è
Important: This is not a welcome message. The AI Agent will start responding immediately upon page load and will consume 1 query credit. Additionally, the feature will not work without updating the code snippet on your website.
Step 6: Update the Code Snippet
Next you need to add this parameter to the code snippet:
prompt="value"
Value will be the message that will be sent as the initial prompt. It can contain any variable passed from your system.
Example usage:
<div id="customgpt_chat"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.customgpt.ai/js/embed.js"
defer
div_id="customgpt_chat"
p_id="123456"
p_key="abcdefgh"
prompt="Hello!"></script>
üöß
Note: Replace the values of p_id, p_key, and prompt with your specific Agent ID, key, and desired initial message. You will need to handle the variable assignments on your own..
How to Disable Pre-Prompt
To disable the Pre-Prompt feature, you can:
a) Turn the Toggle Off
Disabling the toggle will stop the Pre-Prompt from triggering, even if
prompt=""
is still present in your code snippet.
b) Remove the Code Snippet
Remove the
prompt=""
parameter from the code snippet deployed on your website.
üëç
Congratulations! You've successfully enabled the Pre-Prompt feature for your CustomGPT.ai agent. Your AI Agent is now set to automatically respond as soon as the conversation starts, providing an immediate and engaging user experience. ‚úî

How to Add Website Copilot Button to your Website
Suggest Edits
Website Copilot is a modern, large window deployment that provides a balance between visibility and user control over the interaction, allowing for deep dives into conversations when the user is ready.
Visually it looks exactly like
Live Chat window mode
with one significant difference - instead of the icon in the bottom right corner of the screen, Copilot can be added to any HTML element. In this article we will show you how to add Copilot-enabled button to your website.
Add the main code snippet
You should start by adding the following code at the end of your site‚Äôs <
body
> section:
HTML
<script src="https://cdn.customgpt.ai/js/ai-assistant.js" defer="" p_id="AGENT_ID" p_key="AGENT_KEY"></script
You should replace "
AGENT_ID
" and "
AGENT_KEY
" with appropriate values for your agent.
Both
Pre-Prompt functionality
and
CRM Integration
are available with Copilot, and should be set up following their respective guide - including enabling them in the agent‚Äôs settings on the Copilot‚Äôs page.
With the code snippet in place, you have two options to add a button.
Option 1: Use the default CustomGPT.ai button
Simply copy the following code and paste it at the location on your website where you want the button to appear
HTML
<button data-cgpt-ai-assistant data-cgpt-default-button='true' hidden>
	Ask Website Copilot
</button>
If you use this option, you can set the button color in the agent‚Äôs settings on the Copilot‚Äôs page.
Option 2: Use any HTML element
Alternatively, you can simply add this attribute to the element you want to serve as the trigger.
HTML
data-cgpt-ai-assistant
The element's click event will be overridden by the Copilot, and it will open when a user clicks on it. It can be any HTML element, such as a button, link, or image.

How to Add Website Copilot to Any Text Input Field on Your Website
In this guide we will show you how to add Website Copilot to any text input field on your website. When a user types something into that field and presses Enter, the Website Copilot window will open right away and your AI Agent will provide them with an answer!
Suggest Edits
In this guide we will show you how to add a simple input field to your website, which will open Website Copilot when user presses Enter. If you wish a more complex version with a Send button, check out
this guide
.
Step 1: Add Website Copilot to Your Page
The first step is to integrate Website Copilot into your page using the application's deployment instructions. Follow the instructions provided by
Website Copilot
to embed the necessary scripts and components into your webpage.
Step 2: Add Attribute to Input Field
Next, choose a text input field that will be used to trigger the AI Agent. You need to add the attribute "
data-cgpt-ai-assistant-input
" to this input field.
Here is an example of how it should look:
HTML
<input id="cool-id" data-cgpt-ai-assistant-input></input>
‚ùóÔ∏è
Important Notes:
The id attribute is crucial as it will be used in the next step.
The id must have a value. In the example above, it is set to "cool-id".
Step 3: Add Event Listener
The third step is to add a script that will listen for the Enter key in the text input and open your AI Agent. Ensure the script uses the same id as your text input field from Step 2.
Here is the script you can use:
HTML
<script>
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const inputElement = document.getElementById('cool-id');

    inputElement.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
        if (event.key === 'Enter') {
            const inputValue = inputElement.value;
            document.dispatchEvent(
                new CustomEvent('CustomGPTSendQuery', { detail: inputValue })
            );
            inputElement.value = '';
        }
    });
});
</script>
üìò
The script should be placed after the "<body>" section of your webpage.
Ensure the id in "getElementById" matches the "id" of your input field from Step 2.
By following these steps, you can easily add Website Copilot to any text input field on your website, enabling your AI Agent to respond to user queries seamlessly.
Example
Here is how an example page would look like:
HTML
<html>
<body>

<script src="https://cdn.customgpt.ai/js/ai-assistant.js" defer="" p_id="AGENT_ID" p_key="AGENT_KEY"></script>

<input id="cool-id" placeholder="Ask me something‚Ä¶" data-cgpt-ai-assistant-input></input>

</body>

<script>
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
	const inputElement = document.getElementById('cool-id')

	inputElement.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    	if (event.key === 'Enter') {
        	const inputValue = inputElement.value
        	document.dispatchEvent(
            	new CustomEvent('CustomGPTSendQuery', { detail: inputValue })
        	)
        	inputElement.value = ''
    	}
	})
})
</script>

</html>

Congratulations, you have successfully integrated Website Copilot!

The first step is to integrate Website Copilot into your page using the application's deployment instructions. Follow the instructions provided by
Website Copilot
to embed the necessary scripts and components into your webpage.
Step 2: Add Attribute to Input Field
Next, choose a text input field and button that will be used to trigger the AI Agent. You need to add the attribute "
data-cgpt-ai-assistant-input
" to this input field.
Here is an example of how it should look:
HTML
<input id="cool-id" data-cgpt-ai-assistant-input></input>
<button id="cool-arrow">‚û§</button>
‚ùóÔ∏è
Important Notes:
The id attributes on both input and button are crucial as they will be used in the next step.
Both ids must have a value. In the example above, they are set to "cool-id" and "cool-arrow".
Step 3: Add Event Listeners
The third step is to add a script that will listen for both the Enter key in the text input, and Send button, and use them to open your AI Agent. Ensure the script uses the same ids as your text input field and button from Step 2.
Here is the script you can use:
HTML
<script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const inputElement = document.getElementById('cool-id')
    const buttonElement = document.getElementById('cool-arrow')

    function sendQuery() {
        const inputValue = inputElement.value
        if (inputValue.trim()) {
        document.dispatchEvent(
            new CustomEvent('CustomGPTSendQuery', { detail: inputValue })
        )
        inputElement.value = ''
        }
    }

    inputElement.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
        if (event.key === 'Enter') {
        sendQuery()
        }
    })

    buttonElement.addEventListener('click', sendQuery)
    })
</script>
üìò
The script should be placed after the "<body>" section of your webpage.
Ensure the ids in "getElementById" matches the "id" of your input field and button from the Step 2.
By following these steps, you can easily add Website Copilot to any text input field on your website, enabling your AI Agent to respond to user queries seamlessly.
Example
Here is how an example page would look like:
HTML
<html>
<body>

<script src="https://cdn.customgpt.ai/js/ai-assistant.js" defer="" p_id="AGENT_ID" p_key="AGENT_KEY"></script>

<input id="cool-id" placeholder="Ask me something‚Ä¶" data-cgpt-ai-assistant-input></input>
<button id="cool-arrow">‚û§</button>

</body>

<script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const inputElement = document.getElementById('cool-id')
    const buttonElement = document.getElementById('cool-arrow')

    function sendQuery() {
        const inputValue = inputElement.value
        if (inputValue.trim()) {
        document.dispatchEvent(
            new CustomEvent('CustomGPTSendQuery', { detail: inputValue })
        )
        inputElement.value = ''
        }
    }

    inputElement.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
        if (event.key === 'Enter') {
        sendQuery()
        }
    })

    buttonElement.addEventListener('click', sendQuery)
    })
</script>

</html>

Instant Viewer is a version of
Website Copilot
, with the added functionality to serve as a PDF reader. If the agent uses a PDF to generate its response, Instant Viewer can automatically open it and highlight segments that were used for the response - providing more confidence than ever for your users.
üìò
This is our Enterprise feature. If you are interested in enabling it, please
contact our sales team
.
Add the main code snippet
You should start by adding the following code at the end of your site‚Äôs  section:
HTML
<script src="https://cdn.customgpt.ai/js/instant-viewer.js" defer="" p_id="PROJECT_ID" p_key="PROJECT_KEY"></script>
You should replace "
PROJECT_ID
" and "
PROJECT_KEY
" with appropriate values for your project.
Both
Pre-Prompt functionality
and
CRM Integration
are available in Viewer. To enable them, follow their respective setup guides and ensure they are activated in the project settings on the Viewer page
With the code snippet in place, you have two options to add a button.
Option 1: Use the default CustomGPT.ai button
Simply copy the following code and paste it at the location on your website where you want the button to appear.
HTML
<button data-cgpt-instant-viewer data-cgpt-default-button='true' hidden>
	Ask AI
</button>
If you use this option, you can set the button color in the project‚Äôs settings on the Viewer‚Äôs page.
Option 2: Use any HTML element
Alternatively, you can simply add this attribute to the element you want to serve as the trigger.
HTML
data-cgpt-instant-viewer
The element's click event will be overridden by the Viewer, and it will open when a user clicks on it. It can be any HTML element, such as a button, link, or image.

Setting Up Whitelisting for Your CustomGPT.ai Agent
Learn how to secure your CustomGPT.ai agent from potential abuse by setting up domain whitelisting. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to restrict access and enhance security, ensuring your AI Agent operates only on authorized domains.
Suggest Edits
üöß
Setting up whitelisted domain(s) for your agent will result in the agent being accessible only when hosted on the specified domain(s). This also means that the "
Share your AI Agent
" link will not work!
Use this feature if you want to ensure that no one can take your agent's code snippet from your website and place it elsewhere.
Step 1: Sign in
a) Sign in to
https://app.customgpt.ai/
.
Step 2: Go to AI Agent Settings
a) Click on "
AI Agent
".
Step 3: Configure Security Settings
a) Click on "
Security
".
Step 4: Enter Your Whitelisted Domain
Scroll down to the '
Whitelisted Domains
' section. Enter the domains you want to allow, separating them by spaces, tabs, new lines, or commas.
üìò
You can use '*' as a placeholder, which represents any sequence of characters. For example
*
.domain.com will allow all subdomains of domain.com).
üìò
You don't need to include the scheme '
http://
' or '
https://
' (e.g. domain.com).
Step 5: Save Changes
a)  Click on "
Save Changes
".
üëç
Congratulations! You have successfully configured domain whitelisting for your AI Agent. This setting enhances your agent's security by ensuring it can only operate within the environments you specify. You‚Äôre all set to deploy your AI Agent safely and efficiently!

What is GDPR and why it matters
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data privacy law enacted by the European Union (EU) to safeguard individuals' personal data and grant them greater control over how their information is collected, stored, and used. Effective since May 25, 2018, GDPR applies to any organization that processes personal data of individuals in the EU, regardless of where the organization is based. Compliance is crucial not only to meet legal requirements but also to build trust with customers, as it demonstrates a commitment to transparency, data security, and respect for user privacy.
CustomGPT.ai commitment to protecting user data and privacy
GDPR compliance at CustomGPT.ai isn‚Äôt just about legal adherence; it‚Äôs about respecting your privacy and fostering trust. By prioritizing your right to data protection, we aim to not only comply with GDPR but to set an example for data privacy that others can follow. Your trust is our top priority, and through GDPR compliance, we strengthen that bond.
GDPR Compliance Measures
User Consent for Data Collection
From the moment you interact with CustomGPT.ai, your consent is sought. We believe in clear and open communication about what data we collect and why. This means no fine print or confusing terms‚Äîjust straightforward information allowing you to make informed decisions.
Protecting User Data
We treat your data with the utmost care. CustomGPT.ai employs robust security measures to keep your data safe from unauthorized access or leaks. We adhere strictly to data minimization principles, collecting only what‚Äôs necessary to deliver our services and nothing more.
Encryption and security protocols
We use SSL encryption to protect data during transit and industry-standard 256-bit AES encryption to secure data at rest, ensuring the highest levels of data protection.
Data Breach Notifications
If the unexpected happens, we‚Äôre prepared‚Äîand you‚Äôll be the first to know. CustomGPT.ai has systems in place for quick detection of any data breaches. Should one occur, we‚Äôll promptly notify you and guide you through steps to secure your data, while also informing the relevant authorities.
Data Subject Request (DSR) Procedures
Your data belongs to you. With CustomGPT.ai, you can easily access your information and, should you choose, instruct us to delete it. Our processes are designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that managing your data is as simple as asking a question.
üöß
Note: If  you want to submit a DSR, please fill up our
Privacy Request Form
and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
Data Processing Details
We collect, process, and store various types of personal data, including email addresses, usage data, and data communicated during service use. Additional data, such as trackers and activity data, may be collected automatically to support the functionality of our application. This data enables us to provide and improve our services, manage accounts, facilitate payments, and ensure a secure and efficient user experience.
Our processing of personal data is based on legal grounds, including user consent, the necessity to fulfill contractual obligations, compliance with legal requirements, and our legitimate interests, such as ensuring service functionality and preventing fraudulent activity. We adhere to strict security measures to protect data during processing and storage, and data is only retained as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law.
Please consult our
Privacy Policy
for more details.
Third-Party Processors
We work with trusted third-party processors to provide essential services, including hosting, payment processing, email management, and analytics. These include providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hosting, Stripe for payment processing, Google Workspace for productivity, and Automattic (WordPress.com and Gravatar) for platform services. All third-party processors we engage with adhere to GDPR compliance requirements, ensuring that your data is handled securely and in accordance with applicable regulations.
Data shared with these processors is limited to what is necessary to deliver their specific services. For example, payment information is shared directly with payment processors, while hosting providers manage infrastructure and store data securely. Each third party processes data strictly under our instructions and implements robust measures to safeguard your personal information.
Please consult our
Privacy Policy
for more details.
Retention Policy
We retain user data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, such as providing services, complying with legal obligations, or supporting legitimate business interests. Personal data is stored securely and is deleted or anonymized when it is no longer needed. For example, data related to contractual obligations is retained until the contract is fully performed, while data processed based on user consent is deleted upon withdrawal of consent.
In some cases, we may be required to retain data longer to comply with legal requirements or resolve disputes. Once the retention period expires, all personal data is securely deleted or anonymized to ensure it cannot be linked back to any individual.
Please consult our
Privacy Policy
for more details.
Cookie Policy and Consent
We use cookies and similar tracking technologies ("Trackers") on our platform to enhance functionality, improve user experience, and enable essential services. These include both first-party cookies, managed directly by us, and third-party cookies, used by service providers such as Stripe and Google Tag Manager. Depending on the applicable law, certain cookies may require user consent before being set. Users can freely provide or withdraw consent at any time.
To manage cookie preferences, users can access the privacy choices panel available on our platform. Alternatively, users can control or delete cookies through their browser settings, which allow viewing, blocking, or clearing cookies. On mobile devices, cookie preferences can be adjusted in the device's tracking or advertising settings. Note that disabling cookies may impact the functionality and user experience of the platform.

Suggest Edits
Step 1: Sign in to your Affiliate Portal
a) Sign in to
https://customgpt.firstpromoter.com/home
>
Step 2: Access the Referral Link Section
a) Look for the section titled "Share this referral link to your friends and followers (customize link)."
Step 3: Find Your AFFID
a) In the referral link provided in that section (e.g.,
https://customgpt.ai?fpr=hira69
), locate the part that comes after "fpr=" in the link.
b) The AFFID is the ID following "fpr=" in the link. In the given example, the AFFID is "hira69."
c) You can customize your referral link with ease.
‚ùóÔ∏è
Changing the referral token will invalidate any links that have already been shared.
d) You can also create new referral links by entering the name, URL, and Sub-ID.

Sub-IDs allow you to segment or A/B test the traffic directed to your referral link. You can view performance details under Reports > Sub-IDs.

Introduction
Get to know our API. If you are looking for our no-code application, visit
https://app.customgpt.ai/
Jump In
You can interact with
our API
via HTTP requests using any language, or via our dedicated Python SDK. To see some more examples, feel free to look at our
cookbooks
.
To Install our Python SDK, run this command:
Shell
pip install customgpt-client
API Terminology: Agents vs. Projects
In the CustomGPT.ai API,
agents
are referred to as
projects
in endpoint URLs, request/response structures, and parameters. While our platform has fully transitioned to using the term
agents
across the UI and documentation, the API retains the legacy terminology for backward compatibility.
When interacting with the API, any reference to
"projects"
in endpoints, request bodies, query parameters, or responses corresponds to
"agents"
in the current system.
API Keys
To start using our Python SDK or make HTTP requests, you'll need a CustomGPT API key for authentication. Read more about our API keys here, otherwise, you can find or create your key from the API tab in My Profile, accessible by clicking the circle in the top right of the application page. Once you have your key, all HTTP requests should include the key in an authorization HTTP header, as shown below:
Authorization Header
'authorization: Bearer Your_CustomGPT_API_KEY'
Remember: Your API Key is
private
. You should not share it with anyone! This includes making sure you are not exposing it through code. You should route your traffic through your own backend where you can protect your key.
Requests
Get familiar with how to make an API call. Below, you will find two of the most common methods for making your API calls, each with their own benefits.
curl: Curl is easy to set up, as it comes with most operating systems by default. It is a popular command line tool among developers for making HTTP requests due to the minimal setup required, but it is limited in its functionality compared to other programming languages.
Python: Python is an extremely popular programming language due to its wide array of applications in development and ease of use. CustomGPT offers a Python SDK for further simplification, but you can also make HTTP requests with it directly, as shown below.
cURL
Python
curl --request POST \
     --url https://app.customgpt.ai/api/v1/projects \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer API Key' \
     --header 'content-type: multipart/form-data' \
     --form sitemap_path=sitemap \
     --form project_name=projectID
import requests

url = "https://app.customgpt.ai/api/v1/projects"

payload = "-----011000010111000001101001\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"project_name\"\r\n\r\nprojectID\r\n-----011000010111000001101001\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"sitemap_path\"\r\n\r\nsitemap.path\r\n-----011000010111000001101001--"
headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "content-type": "multipart/form-data; boundary=---011000010111000001101001",
    "authorization": "Bearer API Key"
}

response = requests.post(url, data=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)

API Keys and Authentication
To start using CustomGPT's API, authentication via API keys is essential.
How to Generate Your API Key
Generating your API key is the first step towards unlocking the full potential of CustomGPT and AI for you and your knowledge base. To generate your first API key,
log in
to our platform and navigate to
My Profile
, which is reachable by clicking the top right circle on the CustomGPT app page and selecting
My Profile
.
For help logging in or creating your account, visit our
guides
.
From there, select the
API
tab, where you will find a
Create API Key
button at the bottom of the page.
üöß
Attention
Take note of your API key during the generation process, as it will be hidden once you leave the page.
Additionally, make sure to keep your API key private to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches!
Why Use API Keys?
API keys are vital for ensuring that only authorized users can access our services, providing a secure way to authenticate and monitor interactions with our API. By using API keys, we can efficiently manage and control access, enabling us to offer each user a more personalized and secure experience. Additionally, API keys help in tracking usage patterns, which assists in optimizing and improving our services.
Best Practices
To maximize the security of your API interactions, here are some best practices:
Secure Transmission: Always ensure that API keys are transmitted over HTTPS to safeguard against interception.
Permission Limitation: Use API keys with minimal permissions necessary for the tasks at hand to minimize potential risks.
Key Management: Regularly update and promptly deactivate old or compromised API keys.
Usage Monitoring: Keep an eye on API key usage to quickly identify and respond to any unusual activity.
Safe Storage: Avoid embedding API keys directly in your code. Instead, store them in secure, server-side environments or configuration files that are excluded from version control systems.

CustomGPT.ai API
Getting started with CustomGPT's API is quick and easy.
üëç
TL;DR: Don't like reading documentation? Jump straight into our
cookbooks
on GitHub.
This quickstart guide aims to facilitate the process of getting you prepared for your first
API
call. If you are looking for our application, visit
https://app.customgpt.ai/
Overview
As a whole, getting started with the
CustomGPT API
goes as follows:
Create an
Account
or Log In
Acquire your
API Key
Create an
Agent
Create a
Conversation
Send a Message
to the Conversation
This guide will walk you through the above workflow in a bit more detail. Feel free to look around our documentation hub for more information on any part listed.
Step 1: Create an Account or Log In
To use the CustomGPT website and API, you'll need to sign up for an account.
Sign up or log in
here
.
For more information, see our
guide
on creating an account and logging in.
üîí
Shhh!
It is important to keep your password private and not share it with anyone.
Step 2: Acquiring the API key
From
the app
, click on the circle in the top right corner of the dashboard and select the
"My Profile"
option from the dropdown menu that appears.
Select the
API
tab and press the
Create API Key
button to generate a new API key.
üöß
Warning
Make sure to take note of this key when it is created, as you will not get a chance to see it again without deleting it and creating a new key.
Please ensure to keep your API key secure and confidential to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
Step 3: Create an Agent
API Terminology: Agents vs. Projects
In the CustomGPT.ai API,
agents
are referred to as
projects
in endpoint URLs, request/response structures, and parameters. While our platform has fully transitioned to using the term
agents
across the UI and documentation, the API retains the legacy terminology for backward compatibility.
When interacting with the API, any reference to
"projects"
in endpoints, request bodies, query parameters, or responses corresponds to
"agents"
in the current system.
Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. To authenticate with CustomGPT API endpoints, you must provide the API Key in the header, as shown below.
Authentication Header
'authorization: Bearer Your_API_KEY'
For example, you will use the
POST - Create new agent
endpoint to create a new project. In this scenario, you can send an API request by adding your API Key in the Authentication header and the sitemap you wish to use as a data source in the sitemap_path as shown below:
cURL
curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://app.customgpt.ai/api/v1/projects' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer Your_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "project_name": "Test",
  "sitemap_path": "https://example.com/sitemap.xml"
}
'
If you require assistance, or have additional feedback on the API or its documentation, reach out to
cameron@customgpt.ai
Step 4: Create a Conversation
A conversation object represents a forum for communication between a user and the Agent. Conversations can be created every time a new message is sent, or messages can be sent to an existing conversation via the sessionID.
cURL
curl --request POST \
     --url https://app.customgpt.ai/api/v1/projects/projectID/conversations \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer Your_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "name": "New Conversation Name"
}
'
Step 5: Send a Message
Now that a conversation has been created, you can send a message to that conversation. The response you will receive is the response from your AI Agent. To send a message to the conversation, you will need the sessionID and the projectID.
cURL
curl --request POST \
     --url https://app.customgpt.ai/api/v1/projects/ProjectID/conversations/SessionID/messages \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer API-KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "response_source": "default",
  "prompt": "Hello world"
}
'

Shell
curl --request POST \
     --url https://app.customgpt.ai/api/v1/projects \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer APIKey_Here' \
     --header 'content-type: multipart/form-data' \
     --form project_name=Test \
     --form sitemap_path=sitemap.com
Sending Messages
Once you have generated your first agent, it will receive an associated ID. This will be your key to sending a message to your Agent via our API.
Creating a Conversation
First, you must create a Conversation within the Agent. Below, replace 'projectID' with the ID of your new Agent, and 'APIKey_Here' with your actual API key.
Shell
curl --request POST \
     --url https://app.customgpt.ai/api/v1/projects/projectID/conversations \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer APIKey_Here' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json'
     --data '{"name":"Test_Conversation_Name"}'
Sending a Message to the Conversation
Once you have created a Conversation, you can get started by sending a message in that Conversation. In the below example, replace 'projectID' with the ID of your new Agent, 'sessionID' with the session ID of the Conversation created, and 'APIKey_Here' with your actual API key.
Shell
curl --request POST \
     --url https://app.customgpt.ai/api/v1/projects/projectID/conversations/sessionID/messages \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer API_key_Here' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{"prompt":"Hello!"}'
Edit Settings to Enable Streaming
Want to see your answer generated in real-time, piece by piece? Try enabling streaming. You can enable streaming by changing the URL line in the previous snippet to add '?stream=true' to the end:
Shell
--url https://app.customgpt.ai/api/v1/projects/projectID/conversations/sessionID/messages?stream=true \
Here's what a sample streaming output would look like:
Shell
event: start
data: {"status":"start","prompt":"Hello!"}

event: progress
data: {"status":"progress","message":""}

event: progress
data: {"status":"progress","message":"Hello"}

event: progress
data: {"status":"progress","message":"!"}

event: progress
data: {"status":"progress","message":" How"}

event: progress
data: {"status":"progress","message":" can"}

event: progress
data: {"status":"progress","message":" I"}

event: progress
data: {"status":"progress","message":" assist"}

event: progress
data: {"status":"progress","message":" you"}

event: progress
data: {"status":"progress","message":" today"}

event: progress
data: {"status":"progress","message":"?"}

event: finish
data: {"status":"finish","id":2495484,"created_at":"2024-05-23T03:12:49.000000Z","session_id":"99722e7b-9f6d-4f29-8fcf-aae2566e89e8","citations":null}
Parsing the streamed message and compiling it into a full response has many nuances and should be approached with caution. We have examples in our
cookbook
if you wish to learn more.
We also offer the ability to query and receive responses from your CustomGPT agents without streaming. Your output can be expected to look something like this for a non-streamed answer from your CustomGPT chatbot:
Shell
{
  "data": {
    "id": 2495484,
    "created_at": "2024-05-23T03:12:49.000000Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-05-23T03:12:49.000000Z",
    "user_id": 1408827,
    "user_query": "Hello!",
    "openai_response": "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
    "citations": null,
    "metadata": {
      "user_ip": "IP_Address",
      "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/125.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",

üìö Definitions of technical terms for a better understanding of customGPT.
API Key
An API key is a unique code generated by an API that provides authorized access to its features and helps to track and manage API usage, enforce access controls, and monitor API traffic. Get the API Key for the customGPT by following the QuickStart Guide
here
.
Dashboard
CustomGPT's dashboard visually represents key performance indicators and other important data that allows users to monitor and analyze their website's performance and metrics in real time.
Agent
An agent is a single AI-powered chatbot trained on your data and available in the subscription plans, with the standard plan allowing for the creation of 10 chatbots. In contrast, the higher pricing plans offer support for more custom chatbots, enabling customers to create separate chatbots for their website content and support documents for internal use.
API Terminology: Agents vs. Projects
In the CustomGPT.ai API,
agents
are referred to as
projects
in endpoint URLs, request/response structures, and parameters. While our platform has fully transitioned to using the term
agents
across the UI and documentation, the API retains the legacy terminology for backward compatibility.
When interacting with the API, any reference to
"projects"
in endpoints, request bodies, query parameters, or responses corresponds to
"agents"
in the current system.
Project/Agent ID
An ID is a unique identifier assigned to a specific agent that enables access to agent-specific resources and services.
Private Mode
This mode allows users to use the bot for internal use in private mode via the dashboard.
Public Mode
This mode embeds the CustomGPT chatbot on the website for customers and employees to engage with employees, clients, or friends.
Protected Mode
This mode permits sharing with team members and employees for auditing trails and controlled usage.
Sitemap_path
This specifies the path of the sitemap for a particular agent.
White-Label Customization
White-label customizes your CustomGPT chatbot to create a branded experience for the customers and employees with the desired settings. It can customize the logo, background color, or image to align with the brand‚Äôs visual identity. You can also customize the Chatbot language and default source the Chatbot uses to respond.
XML sitemap
An XML sitemap is a structured file that contains all the URLs of a website along with information on the frequency of changes and priority of each page. customGPT uses the website XML sitemap to search engines to improve the crawling and indexing of a website in creating a customized chatbot.
