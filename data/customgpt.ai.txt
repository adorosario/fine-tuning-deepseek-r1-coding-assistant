Frequently asked questions
Do you have a free trial?
Yes, Enjoy full access to all Standard features of
CustomGPT.ai
, for 7 days without any charges.
Who is eligible for the 7-Day Free Trial?
Everyone is eligible for the 7-Day Free Trial at
CustomGPT.ai
. All you need to do is open a new account with us.
What features are included in the Free Trial?
The Free Trial allows you to experience the features specific to the plan you choose during signup—be it standard or premium.
How do I sign up for the Free Trial?
Signing up for the Free Trial is straightforward. Simply
click here
to create an account, and then follow the on-screen instructions to start your trial. You will be asked to provide basic information such as your name, email address, and password.
What happens after the 7-day trial period ends?
Once your 7-day trial period expires, you will automatically be charged for the pricing plan you selected during sign-up.
Is credit card information required to sign up for the Free Trial?
Yes, we require credit card information when you sign up for the Free Trial. This helps us reduce fraud and verify that only genuinely interested users are signing up.
How can I cancel my trial if I decide not to continue?
If you decide that CustomGPT.ai is not for you, canceling your trial is simple. Log in to your account, navigate to the billing page, scroll to the bottom, and you will find the “Cancel Subscription” button. Click it to end your subscription, and you will not be charged.
What kind of support can I expect during the trial period?
During the Free Trial, support is limited but we encourage you to first consult our comprehensive documentation, which can be accessed
here
. If you are interested in exploring more tailored solutions, such as those available with our Enterprise plans, our sales team is readily available to assist you. For such inquiries, please feel free to contact our
sales department
directly.
Is there a guide or tutorial available to help me get started during the Free Trial?
Yes, to help you get started, you can follow our usual
Get Started
guide. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create, customize, and deploy your chatbots.
How can I integrate the chatbot into my website or application?
Integrating your chatbot into your website or application is straightforward. Follow our
Guide
, which includes detailed instructions on integration.
What happens if I hit my plan's limits?
When you hit your plan limit, the system will stop indexing new data (for “word” limits) or stop responding to queries (for “query” limits).
We would suggest signing up to the correct sized plan based on your data and query volume requirements. A good rule of thumb: 10M words is about 50MB of data (your actual words might vary!)
What is words stored?
Words stored is the amount of active words being stored from your indexed content across all of your agents.
The words stored limit operates like a storage limit would on your iPhone or computer. When data is added, it goes up, and when data is removed, it goes down.
Are words stored shared among my bots, or are they per individual bot?
Words stored are counted on an account level, meaning all your bots share the same limit. If you need a higher limit, please contact our
sales team
.
Are monthly GPT-4 queries shared among my bots, or are they per individual bot?
Monthly GPT-4 queries are counted on an account level, meaning all your bots share the same limit. If you need a higher limit, please contact our
sales team
.
Does it cost anything to add my team?
Standard plan is the best for small teams. Pricing scales up with the usage of credits across your account. If you have multiple team members, then Premium and Enterprise plans are better suited to your needs and with these you will receive a higher level of support.
What is CustomGPT's refund policy?
We hold our customers responsible for managing their accounts, credit limits, and overages.
Refunds are only applicable to the current subscription charge on your account, not for overage
charges from the prior month or additional charges added to your account. Please note that we
incur significant charges to index your content and respond to chatbot queries.
Is the content from CustomGPT original?
The content generated by CustomGPT is based on the content indexed in your agent + the
general language models supported by ChatGPT.
What are the available payment methods?
CustomGPT supports all major credit cards and debit cards. We secure your payment method
using Stripe for your privacy and protection.
CustomGPT does not accept Paypal, prepaid cards, or other cash apps at this time.
Where can I read reviews of CustomGPT?
Ever since we built CustomGPT (for our own needs actually!), we have been inundated with
friends and business colleagues who want their own CustomGPT. Please see the testimonials
What's the fastest way to learn how to use CustomGPT?
Please see our
FAQ
to get started. Even better: Just
ask our CustomGPT chatbot
in the bottom right corner. This chatbot has indexed all of our business content. If you still need help, just email
hello@customgpt.ai
.
Does CustomGPT read or write in other languages?
Yes, CustomGPT supports 92+ popular languages.
Can I remove the "Powered by CustomGPT" Branding?
Yes – you can now white-label and remove the “Powered by CustomGPT” branding (requires Premium plan or higher)

Frequently Asked Questions
How does CustomGPT.ai use my data to build a custom ChatGPT-type chatbot?
CustomGPT.ai uses your data to build a custom chatbot by ingesting the information you provide into our system. This information can include your company’s public content like websites, knowledge bases , helpdesks, Youtube videos, and podcasts but also private content like business and product information documents including PDF, Microsoft Office documents, Google docs, customer data,  and other relevant content.
Our
secure and privacy-preserving
cloud platform then ingests this content and uses this information to respond to queries with ChatGPT.
The result is a Custom ChatGPT-style bot that can have a deep understanding of your business and customers, allowing it to provide personalized and accurate responses,
without hallucinations
, to a wide range of inquiries. This bot can then be embedded into your website, used as a LiveChat or integrated into your systems via the API.
How can I provide my content and data to CustomGPT.ai?
You can provide your business content and data to CustomGPT.ai in various ways, using the CustomGPT.ai interface for your project.
You can provide the sitemap of your website or create a
custom sitemap
, using which CustomGPT.ai can index the entire content of your website and refresh it periodically to check for any new content.
You can also upload ALL your documents like PDF file, Microsoft Office documents, Google docs, etc. The platform supports 1400+ document formats including audio formats and podcasts.
Finally, you can use one of the many data integrations options available at
Integations page
.
Can I build the bot with PDF or Microsoft Office or Google Docs files I have?
Yes. You can
upload your documents
in 1400+ formats including PDFs, Microsoft Office docs, Google docs.
We also support Youtube/Vimeo videos and audio/podcast files. We support the most extensive suite of document formats in the industry.
Can CustomGPT.ai read and understand tables in PDF files?
CustomGPT.ai does read the text from the tables (in PDF and Excel/CSV files). However, do note: ChatGPT (and CustomGPT.ai) is quite bad at analytics and math. So if your use case is related to counting and analytics, CustomGPT.ai might not be a good choice.
However, anything related to searching for content in the tables and then creating text responses based off that, should work remarkably well.
Can I upload various file formats like .pdf, .xls, and others for CustomGPT.ai to analyze?
Yes, CustomGPT.ai supports 1400 file formats including PDF, Microsoft Office documents, Google Docs, Text files, and Audio/Video files.
Do you have a Zapier App?
Yes – we now have a full bi-directional Zapier app. You can send data from your apps and tools to your chatbot. And also query your chatbot from various Zapier integrations like Slack and SMS. See more details here:
https://customgpt.ai/chatgpt-zapier/
How long does it take CustomGPT.ai to ingest my data?
On average, it takes a few minutes to fully index your data.
The exact time it takes will depend on the amount and type of data. File processing is quick (seconds). Website crawling could take longer (minutes or hours depending on the speed and size of your website). Most small business bots build in less than 5 mins.
Is CustomGPT.ai secure and privacy-compliant?
Yes. Your data is fully encrypted and files are stored only when you choose to. Files are encrypted in transit, and encrypted at rest. We use secure vendors like AWS and Stripe. See our full list of
security principles
.
Moreover, your chatbot is fully-self contained, which means it does not share ANY data with other chatbots, even within your own account.
And by default, your chatbot is private, which means only authorized users can query your chatbot. We understand the importance of your data security and privacy and are fully committed to ensure that the chatbot and your data are secure, confidential and private.
As of March 1st 2023, OpenAI has
confirmed
that they
do not use your data
for training purposes.  Since we use the ChatGPT API, no parts of your data will be used for training purposes by OpenAI.
Does OpenAI use my data for training purposes?
As of March 1st 2023, OpenAI has now clarified that they do NOT use data from API calls in their training. And as we use the ChatGPT API, your data and queries are NOT used in any of their ML training.
Can CustomGPT.ai be integrated with email or SMS services?
Yes – using the Zapier app or the API. Please see: https://docs.CustomGPT.ai/reference/quickstart-guide – you can easily connect it to Google Mail or Twilio SMS or 5000+ other integrations.
Can I upload documents using the CustomGPT.ai platform?
Yes, you can upload documents using the CustomGPT.ai platform. Simply go to your CustomGPT.ai dashboard and upload the documents to build your custom chatbots in minutes. We support 1400+ document formats and the platform is built to process multi-gigabytes of documents. However, each file cannot exceed 100MB at this time. If your file is larger than that, we suggest using an online file splitter to break it up into smaller files.
Can I train CustomGPT.ai with both a sitemap and documents?
Yes, CustomGPT.ai now supports multi-source data integration, allowing you to train the chatbot with both a sitemap and documents. To do this, simply add your sitemap and upload the desired documents to your project. CustomGPT.ai will then consolidate the data from all the sources and provide context-aware answers based on the combined knowledge.
How can I add multiple sitemaps or PDF documents to an existing project?
To add multiple sitemaps or PDF documents to an existing project, simply go to your project settings and use the “Data” tab. You can then select the type of content you want to add (Sitemap, Upload, etc.) and provide the necessary information. CustomGPT.ai will integrate the new data sources with the existing content, enhancing the chatbot’s knowledge base.
How can I use both my website and uploaded documents as content sources for CustomGPT.ai?
To use both your website and uploaded documents as content sources, start by adding your website’s sitemap to your project. Next, upload the desired documents, such as PDFs, Word files, or Google Docs, using the “Data” tab in the project settings. CustomGPT.ai will then combine the content from your website and documents to create a comprehensive knowledge base for the chatbot.
Can CustomGPT.ai ingest both PDFs and web pages in a single project?
Yes, CustomGPT.ai is designed to ingest and integrate multiple content types, including PDFs and web pages, within a single project. Simply add the web pages by providing the sitemap and upload the desired PDF documents using the “Data” tab. CustomGPT.ai will consolidate the data, allowing the chatbot to provide context-aware responses based on the combined information.
Can I add a list of webpages to my chatbot project?
Yes – now you can. Simply use this
free tool
to create a new sitemap from your list of web pages and add that sitemap to your project. This feature lets you add content from any Internet page. For example: You can add discussions and reviews from around the Internet to your chatbot. You could even add competitor pages or authoritative documents to make your chatbot smarter.
Can I add the results from Google searches into the chatbot?
Yes – this is a common feature requested by researchers and SEOs. You can do this in two ways:
Build a custom list of URLs using this
free tool
and then add the sitemap to your project.
Use this
free tool
and give it a list of search queries. The tool will then build a sitemap based on the list of search results based on those queries. Add the sitemap to your project.
How do I connect my YouTube channel to CustomGPT.ai?
To connect your YouTube channel to CustomGPT.ai, simply select YouTube as the integration option within the platform. Then, paste the link to your YouTube channel.
What types of YouTube videos can be transcribed and used to train the chatbot?
Any videos from your YouTube channel can be transcribed and used to train the chatbot.
How does CustomGPT.ai ensure the privacy and security of my YouTube content?
CustomGPT.ai is built on strong privacy principles, ensuring that any information uploaded to a bot remains within that bot’s environment and is not shared with other bots, even those in the same account. For more details, please visit our security principles at
CustomGPT.ai Security
.
Can I edit the transcriptions before they are used to train the chatbot?
No, the transcription process is fully automated and done in the background. This ensures a seamless and efficient integration of your video content into the chatbot’s knowledge base.
How frequently are new videos from my YouTube channel transcribed and added to the chatbot?
The frequency of transcription depends on your auto-sync settings. Auto-sync is a premium feature that allows new videos to be transcribed and added to the chatbot’s knowledge base automatically, ensuring that the chatbot is always up-to-date.
What happens if a video uploaded to CustomGPT.ai is deleted?
If you have auto-sync enabled, the deleted video will also be removed from CustomGPT.ai.
Can I disconnect my YouTube channel from CustomGPT.ai at any time?
Yes, you can disconnect your YouTube channel from CustomGPT.ai at any time.
Can I use YouTube videos from other channels, not just my own, to train the chatbot?
Yes, you can use YouTube videos from other channels to train the chatbot.
What happens if my YouTube channel is private or has restricted access?
If your YouTube channel is private or has restricted access, CustomGPT.ai will not be able to retrieve and transcribe the videos.
How do I know which videos have been successfully transcribed and added to the chatbot?
You can check the status of your transcriptions on your project’s Pages screen within CustomGPT.ai. This screen provides a comprehensive overview of all the videos that have been successfully transcribed and added to the chatbot’s knowledge base.
What is the new Zendesk integration feature about?
The new Zendesk integration feature is about leveraging the power of Zendesk’s help center to enhance the capabilities of your CustomGPT.ai chatbot. By using Zendesk as a source for your bot, you can provide instant, accurate, and comprehensive assistance to your users, drawing from the wealth of information in your Zendesk help center.
How does the Zendesk integration feature work?
The Zendesk integration feature works by connecting your Zendesk help center with your CustomGPT.ai chatbot.Once the connection is established, the chatbot fetches pages from your Zendesk help center, which allows it to provide more accurate and helpful responses to user queries.
What are the benefits of using the Zendesk integration feature?
Firstly, it allows your users to get instant help from your chatbot, which now has access to the entire knowledge base of your Zendesk help center. This not only improves the user experience but also reduces the workload on your human customer service agents. Secondly, it allows you to leverage the comprehensive and often underutilized knowledge in your Zendesk help center, thereby increasing the return on your investment in Zendesk.
How can customers access the Zendesk integration feature?
Customers can access the Zendesk integration feature either during the project creation process or via the Data tab after the project has been created.
What makes the Zendesk integration feature different from similar features in the market?
The Zendesk integration feature stands out in the market due to its ability to bring together a wealth of business knowledge with easy-to-integrate, no-code chatbots.
How can the Zendesk integration feature help in improving customer service?
The Zendesk integration feature can significantly improve customer service by providing fast and accurate help to end-users at a fraction of the cost of human agents.

What is the Protected Data Ingestion feature?
The Protected Data Ingestion feature is a specialized service offered by CustomGPT.ai that enables the crawling and ingestion of data from websites protected by authentication mechanisms. This feature is designed to help businesses access and utilize data that is otherwise restricted due to login requirements, making it possible to build chatbots that can interact with and provide insights from this protected data.
How does the Protected Data Ingestion feature work?
The Protected Data Ingestion feature works through a collaborative process where our engineers work closely with your team to develop a custom solution tailored to your specific needs. This involves understanding your authentication methods and integrating them into our system to ensure seamless data access and ingestion. The goal is to create a solution that works efficiently for your company, allowing your chatbot to access and utilize protected data as needed.
Which types of authentication methods are supported by the Protected Data Ingestion feature?
The Protected Data Ingestion feature is highly customizable, and our team will work to support any authentication method you have in place. Whether it’s basic authentication, OAuth, SAML, or any other form of login protection, we will strive to develop a solution that meets your requirements and ensures secure access to your protected data.
Is the Protected Data Ingestion feature available for all customers?
No, the Protected Data Ingestion feature is an enterprise-only offering.
How can enterprise customers request the Protected Data Ingestion feature?
Enterprise customers interested in the Protected Data Ingestion feature can request it by contacting our sales team. Please visit
https://customgpt.ai/contact-sales/

How does CustomGPT.ai ensure the privacy of the data accessed through the Protected Data Ingestion feature?
CustomGPT.ai is built on strong privacy principles, ensuring that any information uploaded to a bot remains within that bot’s environment and is not shared with other bots, even those within the same account. For more details on our security principles, please visit
https://customgpt.ai/security/
.
Additionally, your data will not be incorporated into OpenAI training sets. For more information, please see OpenAI’s announcement and data usage policy at
https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies
.
What are the benefits of using the Protected Data Ingestion feature for enterprise customers?
The primary benefit of using the Protected Data Ingestion feature is the ability to build chatbots that can access and utilize data protected by authentication mechanisms in an automated way.
How long does it take to set up the Protected Data Ingestion feature for a new customer?
The setup time for the Protected Data Ingestion feature varies depending on the complexity of your system and the specific authentication methods in place. Our team will work with you to understand your requirements and develop a timeline that ensures a smooth and efficient implementation.
How does the Protected Data Ingestion feature integrate with existing CustomGPT.ai functionalities?
Once set up, the Protected Data Ingestion feature will function similarly to the Sitemap feature, allowing your chatbot to access and utilize the ingested data seamlessly.
Can the Protected Data Ingestion feature be used to access data from multiple protected websites?
Yes, the Protected Data Ingestion feature can be used to access data from multiple protected websites. However, if the authentication methods differ between these websites, separate solutions will likely be required to handle each unique authentication process.
How does the Protected Data Ingestion feature handle updates or changes in the authentication methods of the target websites?
The handling of updates or changes in the authentication methods of target websites depends on the specific case. Our team will work with you to ensure that any changes are addressed promptly and that the custom solution remains functional and secure.

Have questions about the CustomGPT.ai API?
Is CustomGPT.ai GDPR compliant?
Yes, CustomGPT.ai is fully GDPR compliant. We prioritize the protection of user data, adhere to strict data security standards, and ensure transparency in how personal data is collected, processed, and stored.
What is GDPR, and why does it matter?
The
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
is a data privacy law enacted by the European Union to protect individuals’ personal data. It gives users more control over how their information is collected, used, and stored.
GDPR applies to any organization processing the personal data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is based.
Compliance is essential for legal adherence, but it also builds trust by demonstrating a strong commitment to user privacy and data security.

How does CustomGPT.ai protect user data?
We employ robust measures to ensure your data is secure:
Encryption protocols
: SSL encryption for data in transit and 256-bit AES encryption for data at rest.
Data minimization
: We only collect the information necessary to deliver and improve our services.
Strict security measures
: Data is safeguarded against unauthorized access or leaks.
What happens in case of a data breach?
CustomGPT.ai has systems in place to detect data breaches quickly. If a breach occurs:
We will promptly notify you and provide guidance on securing your data.

How can I access, modify, or delete my personal data?

Privacy Request Form

We collect and process:
User data

Tracking data
: Cookies and activity data collected automatically for platform functionality and improvement.
Our processing is based on legal grounds such as user consent, contractual necessity, legal obligations, and legitimate interests like fraud prevention. For more details, please consult our
Privacy Policy
.
Does CustomGPT.ai use third-party processors?
Yes, we work with trusted GDPR-compliant third-party providers for essential services, such as:
Hosting
: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Payments
: Stripe
Productivity
: Google Workspace
Platform services
: Automattic (WordPress.com, Gravatar)

Does CustomGPT.ai support data residency within the EU?
No, CustomGPT.ai does not currently support data residency within the EU. Data residency in the EU is not a requirement for GDPR compliance.
Why is data residency not required for GDPR compliance?
GDPR compliance focuses on how personal data is handled, processed, and secured, regardless of where the data is physically stored. Data residency within the EU is not a strict requirement under GDPR.
What should I do if I need data residency within the EU?
If your organization requires data to be stored within the EU, you may need to find a local hosting provider (if one exists) or set up your own hosting solution. Please note that building your own solution can be a complex and time-consuming process.
If data residency is mandatory for your use case, consider exploring external hosting options or consulting with CustomGPT.ai support for potential workarounds or recommendations.
How can CustomGPT.ai assure customers of GDPR compliance without EU data residency?
CustomGPT.ai adheres to GDPR regulations by implementing robust data protection practices, securing personal data, and providing transparency in how data is processed and stored.

For an in-depth understanding of how we ensure data protection, please refer to our security principles at
https://customgpt.ai/security/
. We are committed to regularly updating and improving our security practices to protect your business data effectively.
Is our business data used to train the ChatGPT model?
No, your business data is not used to train the ChatGPT model. The information you provide when interacting with CustomGPT stays strictly within your specific bot instance and is not incorporated into any OpenAI model training. See OpenAI’s data usage policy:
https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies
.
Are you using the general ChatGPT? Or private instances on Azure?
CustomGPT, while built on top of the OpenAI’s ChatGPT API, operates within its private VPC instance in Amazon AWS US East. This ensures that your data and interactions are segregated and not mixed with the general ChatGPT usage or with other users.
The infrastructure specifics, like the usage of AWS or another cloud service are laid out in our privacy policy:
https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/45263214
Does Custom GPT support the GDPR?
CustomGPT supports the GDPR by having policies in place that protect your privacy and data rights. CustomGPT is also SOC 2 Type 2 certified, ensuring compliance to data security and privacy measures.
How does CustomGPT comply with the GDPR?
CustomGPT complies with the GDPR by getting user consent for data collection, protecting user data, allowing users to access or delete their data, notifying users of data breaches, and ensuring third-party vendors also follow GDPR rules.
Can I get a DPA?
Customers on our Enterprise plan may complete our
DPA Form
to execute our Data Privacy Addendum. This agreement is only available for Enterprise customers. Non-enterprise customers are unable to enter into a DPA with CustomGPT. Additionally, CustomGPT cannot customize DPAs for individual cases.
Can I request to download or delete my data?
Complete our
Privacy Request Form
to request to download or delete all of your data.
How long does CustomGPT retain my data?
CustomGPT keeps your data until you decide what to do with it. You can use CustomGPT’s capabilities to delete your documents immediately after processing. If you choose to keep the documents to benefit from features like citations and links, they’ll stay with CustomGPT until you choose to remove them.
How does CustomGPT handle breach management?
If you believe there’s a security issue or that someone might have gotten unauthorized access to data on CustomGPT, send us an email at ops@customgpt.ai. Don’t worry, we won’t share your email with others. We promise to take your concern seriously and will thoroughly investigate the matter.
Is CustomGPT SOC 2 Compliant?

Frequently Asked Questions
What does the term "hallucination" mean in the context of AI?
In AI, “hallucination” refers to instances where AI generates information that is not grounded in reality or the provided context, leading to potentially misinformed decision-making and other issues.
Why is anti-hallucination important for AI technology?
Anti-hallucination is crucial because it helps ensure the reliability and accuracy of AI-generated information, reducing risks such as compliance issues, safety risks, and erosion of trust in AI systems.
Can I feed my company's specific data into CustomGPT.ai to make it more relevant to my business needs?
Absolutely! CustomGPT.ai is designed to ingest your business content and utilize that information to respond to queries. This ensures that all responses are tailored specifically to your business needs, using only the information relevant to your company.
What industries can benefit the most from CustomGPT.ai's technology?
Industries where accuracy is paramount, such as legal sectors, finance, healthcare, and education, can particularly benefit from CustomGPT.ai’s technology.
What companies and institutions rely on CustomGPT.ai?
Nearly 6,000 entities, including Adobe, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Dominican Republic’s GPTLegal, and the UK’s DivorceOnline, rely on CustomGPT.ai.
How can I ensure the responses from CustomGPT.ai are not derived from general internet data but strictly from my business content?
We’ve implemented an innovative context boundary wall to address this. This feature establishes a strict boundary around the responses of CustomGPT.ai, ensuring they’re derived solely from your business content. Any general or unrelated internet data is effectively walled out.
I’ve noticed in the past that chatbot responses have included inaccurate information. How can I be sure this won't happen with CustomGPT.ai?
Our context boundary wall feature solves this issue. By constraining the chatbot’s responses to the information contained in your business content, we can significantly reduce the chance of inaccurate or irrelevant responses. We continuously refine this technology to ensure its effectiveness and accuracy.
How can I test the effectiveness of the context boundary wall feature?
You can test this feature by asking questions that fall outside of your business context. For instance, asking “Why did the chicken cross the road?” or “Who is Joe Biden?” should result in the AI declining to answer or providing a neutral response. This indicates that the AI recognizes the query as outside its boundary and won’t provide information it hasn’t been indexed.
What if the responses generated by CustomGPT.ai still seem off-topic or inaccurate?
If you encounter any issues, please reach out to our customer support team. We’re committed to ensuring that CustomGPT.ai meets your needs and expectations, and we’re always ready to assist you. We constantly update and improve our systems based on user feedback, and your input is invaluable to us. (support@customgpt.ai)
How does CustomGPT.ai differentiate between accurate data and ‘hallucinations' when generating responses?
CustomGPT.ai uses the context provided by the documents and sitemaps you upload in order to generate responses. Based on this content, if the chatbot deems that it does not “know” an answer, it will simply admit it: “I don’t know.” This honesty prevents the chatbot from lying or hallucinating in an attempt to provide an unfactual answer. This process is built upon 10,000+ hours of development and engineering and we’re proud that we can pass these benefits on to you.
What measures can I take if I encounter hallucinatory responses from CustomGPT.ai?
This should not occur. We’ve spent countless hours developing technology that solves the hallucination problem. If you think your CustomGPT.ai bot is hallucinating, please get in touch with support so we can get to the root of your issue: support@customgpt.ai
What steps does CustomGPT.ai take to prevent hallucinations during interactions?
To reassure users that our chatbots’ replies aren’t hallucinatory, we’ve created the “Citations” feature. Every time your bot generates a response using your business content, it will also return the exact sources it used to answer the query. This way, you know that the bot isn’t hallucinating because you can see exactly where it got its information from.
How does CustomGPT handle hallucinations?
CustomGPT.ai has developed advanced anti-hallucination features based on user feedback. The system continually improves by analyzing and addressing hallucinations at various stages of the RAG pipeline.
What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?
RAG is a technique that combines retrieval of information from a knowledge base with generation of text by an AI model to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.
When was RAG first introduced?
The concept of RAG was first referenced in a research paper published around 2020 by the FAIR research group at Meta.
What are the main benefits of using RAG?
The main benefits include reduced hallucinations, the ability to use your own corporate data, and providing more accurate and contextually relevant answers.
What is the recommended approach for handling hallucinations in a RAG pipeline?
Implement anti-hallucination measures at every stage of the RAG pipeline, not just in the prompt. This includes preprocessing user queries, engineering prompts, selecting suitable LLM models, and validating AI responses.
In what scenarios might AI chatbots like ChatGPT hallucinate and why?
AI chatbots like ChatGPT might “hallucinate,” or generate incorrect or nonsensical information, in scenarios where:
The question or topic is highly complex or requires expertise beyond the model’s training data.
The input is ambiguous, lacks sufficient context, or contains contradictions.
The topic is obscure, not well-represented in the training data, or is a novel event that occurred after the model’s last training update.
The prompt contains misleading cues or false information, leading the model to generate responses based on those cues.
Prompts that ask for creative writing or speculative content can lead to plausible but factually incorrect responses.
How can hallucination levels be quantitatively tested?
By using an LLM-agent to validate the context, prompt, and AI response, and calculating metrics like a quality score for each response to monitor and optimize the system over time.
What recent benchmark did CustomGPT.ai excel in?
CustomGPT.ai excelled in a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) benchmark analysis
comparing its generative AI platform with OpenAI’s Assistant API V2. The testing involved 945 questions across nine diverse datasets.
How did CustomGPT.ai perform compared to OpenAI?
CustomGPT.ai outperformed OpenAI by achieving a 10 percent lower hallucination rate, 13 percent higher accuracy rate, and 34 percent faster average response time.
Why is achieving 97% accuracy in anti-hallucination measures considered insufficient?
In critical applications, even a small percentage of hallucinations can lead to significant issues. Just like uptime or security, near-perfect performance is required to avoid problems.
What is the primary objective of the benchmarking project for CustomGPT.ai?
The core objective is to benchmark CustomGPT.ai’s performance against OpenAI’s latest Assistant API V2, focusing on reducing AI hallucinations and improving accuracy. The goal is to
validate improvements in CustomGPT.ai’s algorithms
, which make it a superior AI solution for industries requiring high precision, such as legal, medical, and financial services.
How was the test conducted to ensure a fair comparison between CustomGPT.ai and OpenAI?
The test used a systematic methodology aligned with industry best practices, including:
A dataset of 945 diverse questions
Nine distinct datasets covering various topics
The “Answer Consistency Binary” metric for evaluation
Controlled test environment with identical hardware and software for both models
What is the “Answer Consistency Binary” metric, and why was it used?
The “Answer Consistency Binary” metric evaluates AI responses by checking if the response is entirely consistent with the provided context. It scores responses as either 1 (consistent) or 0 (inconsistent), making it a stringent and clear measure of accuracy and effective in detecting hallucinations.
How did CustomGPT.ai perform in terms of inconsistent and consistent responses compared to OpenAI?
Inconsistent responses (score 0):
OpenAI: 513 instances
CustomGPT.ai: 457 instances
Consistent responses (score 1):
OpenAI: 432 instances
CustomGPT.ai: 488 instances
How can interested parties learn more about the study and its findings?

Frequently Asked Questions
What are ChatGPT Custom Instructions Templates?
ChatGPT custom instructions templates are pre-defined sets of instructions that help users quickly set up their directives. These templates can be customized to fit specific needs. You can
read more here
.
How do I create Custom Instructions for ChatGPT?
To create custom instructions, identify your needs, draft specific directives, and input these instructions into the CustomGPT.ai platform.
Can I create more than one ChatGPT Persona? Is there a limit?
Yes. You can create multiple custom instructions. There is no limit. In fact, having multiple templates and personas for your company is a good idea. For example: You can have a “Customer Service Agent”, “Sales Agent”, “Support Staff Agent”, “Accounting Expert” and so on.
What are some examples of Custom Instructions for ChatGPT?
Examples include directing the AI to respond in a certain tone, generate specific types of content, or explain topics in a particular manner.
How do I input Custom Instructions in ChatGPT?
Input your custom instructions through the CustomGPT.ai interface, where you can specify your directives and manage your settings.
How do I create a ChatGPT Persona using your tool?
Just start off the conversation with the AI tool and describe your company, brand or persona. For example, you could say “I am a weight loss coach specializing in cool sculpting” or “Our company is a global leader in selling high-value seeds” or “Our brand Wheelies Shoes specializes in shoes made from car tires.”
What is a persona builder and how does it work in your tool?
This builder is a chatbot built using CustomGPT. It was trained with content about personas and custom instructions. The instructions for this tool itself were then created using a technique called “self criticism” to optimize persona creation. This tool was created in a few minutes using no-code.
The best part: Any non-technical person can create tools like this using only the English language and the CustomGPT platform.
Can I modify or update a ChatGPT Persona I have already created?
Yes — this tool works like ChatGPT, so if you are not satisfied with its output, then ask it to revise the output. It helps to use “Chain of Thought” prompting so that the instructions are detailed.
For example: “That was excellent. Please revise the above instructions to encourage the customer to buy our weekend package.”
Is there a cost associated with using your persona builder tool?
No. This tool is completely free. However, if you’d like to build such tools, you will need a CustomGPT plan:
https://customgpt.ai/pricing
Can I use the personas I create with your tool for commercial purposes?
Yes.
Who should I contact if I encounter issues while using your tool or have more questions?

Who has access to the Search Generative Experience feature?
The Search Generative Experience feature is accessible to all our users. We believe in providing all our customers with the most innovative and efficient tools to enhance their website’s functionality and user experience.
How does the Search Generative Experience feature work?
The Search Generative Experience feature works by intercepting search parameters from the URL of your website.

These results, along with their sources, are then displayed ahead of regular search results, providing a more efficient and interactive search experience.
How can I implement the Search Generative Experience feature on my website?
Implementing the Search Generative Experience feature on your website is straightforward. You simply need to copy the provided code from your bot’s sharing page and add it to your website’s search results page where you want the Search Generative Experience to be displayed.

Can I sign up using my own referral link?
No. Self-referrals are strictly prohibited. The aim of a referral program is to encourage affiliates and ambassadors to spread the word about our product(s), not to get discounts. Attempts to get credit for your own purchase will result in termination of your affiliate membership.

Frequently Asked Questions
Getting Started
How It Works
Fix A Problem
Plan, Payments, Billing
Getting Started
What is CustomGPT and how does it work?
CustomGPT creates your own custom ChatGPT chatbot with all your business content. You then get accurate, trusted ChatGPT responses from your content without making up facts. All within a secure, privacy-first, business-grade platform.
It works by ingesting your data, including your website content, helpdesk, knowledge bases, documents, Youtube videos, podcasts, etc and uses this information to let ChatGPT respond to customer and employee inquiries.
So in short: Anything that you can do with ChatGPT but
with your data
.
The result is a personalized ChatGPT-powered chatbot that is
unique to your business
and understands all the details of your products, services, and customers. With CustomGPT, you can improve your employee efficiency and customer experience with generative AI.
How does CustomGPT use my data to build a custom ChatGPT-type chatbot?
CustomGPT uses your data to build a custom chatbot by ingesting the information you provide into our system. This information can include your company’s public content like websites, knowledge bases , helpdesks, Youtube videos, and podcasts but also private content like business and product information documents including PDF, Microsoft Office documents, Google docs, customer data,  and other relevant content.
Our
secure and privacy-preserving
cloud platform then ingests this content and uses this information to respond to queries with ChatGPT.
The result is a Custom ChatGPT-style bot that can have a deep understanding of your business and customers, allowing it to provide personalized and accurate responses,
without hallucinations
, to a wide range of inquiries. This bot can then be embedded into your website, used as a LiveChat or integrated into your systems via the API.
How do I get started with CustomGPT and how do I subscribe to the service?
To get started with CustomGPT, simply
sign up
for a subscription to our service. After the 2-minute setup, our system will get to work building a custom chatbot trained on your specific content.
You can get started quickly just by uploading your documents. Or you can use your website sitemap. Or you can use one of our
free tools
. Our
subscription plans
are simple and flexible, so you can select the one that best fits your business requirements and budget.
What is the pricing model for CustomGPT and how does it work?
CustomGPT offers the following pricing models to meet a variety of business needs.
Standard
($99 /Month)
: 10 custom chatbots (agents); 5000 pages/chatbot; 60 million words content, 1000 queries/month
Premium
($499 /Month)
: 100 custom chatbots (agents); 20,000 pages/chatbot; 300 million words content, 5000 queries/month

Please visit our
pricing
page to see the full set of features and subscription plans.
How can I provide my content and data to CustomGPT?
You can provide your business content and data to CustomGPT in various ways, using the CustomGPT interface for your agent.
You can provide the sitemap of your website or create a
custom sitemap
, using which CustomGPT can index the entire content of your website and refresh it periodically to check for any new content.
You can also upload ALL your documents like PDF file, Microsoft Office documents, Google docs, etc. The platform supports 1400+ document formats including audio formats and podcasts.
New: You can now also mix-and-match and
add data from  multiple sources
to create a “source of truth” with your chatbot.
Update: We now have a
Zapier
integration so that you can easily ingest content from all your tools and apps.
Can I white-label and customize the bot to my branding and business?
Yes. You can personalize your CustomGPT chatbot to create a branded experience for your customers and employees, with the desired settings. See
this example
of a branded chatbot.
You can
customize
the logo, background color or image to align with your brand’s visual identity. You can also customize the Chatbot language and default source used by the Chatbot to provide responses.
New: And now,  “Premium”  and “Enterprise” plans can remove the “Powered by CustomGPT” branding for a true while-label / reseller experience.
Update: And now with our new
API
, you can dynamically create chatbots and re-sell them to your clients.
Can I build the bot with PDF or Microsoft Office or Google Docs files I have?
Yes. You can
upload your documents
in 1400+ formats including PDFs, Microsoft Office docs, Google docs.
We also support Youtube/Vimeo videos and audio/podcast files. We support the most extensive suite of document formats in the industry.
I'm not technical. Can I just Upload my documents and build the bot?
Yes, you can simply go to your CustomGPT dashboard, and upload the documents to build your custom chatbots in minutes! CustomGPT is a no-code ChatGPT chatbot builder requiring zero technical expertise.
Can I build a Chatbot for Competitive Intelligence?
Yes, you can upload your competitor’s sitemap and use that for competitive insights. You can even
upload documents
or add
data from multiple sources
to build a consolidated “source of truth” on your competitor.
Can CustomGPT read and understand tables in PDF files?
CustomGPT does read the text from the tables (in PDF and Excel/CSV files). However, do note: ChatGPT (and CustomGPT) is quite bad at analytics and math. So if your use case is related to counting and analytics, CustomGPT might not be a good choice.
However, anything related to searching for content in the tables and then creating text responses based off that, should work remarkably well.
How do I integrate CustomGPT with my application using the API key? Where is the API documentation?
The documentation about using CustomGPT API is available at the following link:
https://docs.customgpt.ai/reference/quickstart-guide
Can I upload various file formats like .pdf, .xls, and others for CustomGPT to analyze?
Yes, CustomGPT supports 1400 file formats including PDF, Microsoft Office documents, Google Docs, Text files, and Audio/Video files.
How can I train CustomGPT with my specific content or data?
Yes, you can upload specific files and sitemaps with specific URLs to train your CustomGPT chatbots.
Do you have an API?
Yes – please see :
https://docs.customgpt.ai/reference/quickstart-guide
PS: Here is an initial cookbook (
https://github.com/Poll-The-People/customgpt-cookbook
). More guides and cookbooks should be on the way soon.
Do you have a free trial?
Yes, Enjoy full access to all Standard features of
CustomGPT.ai
, for 7 days without any charges.
Do you have a Zapier App?
Yes – we now have a full bi-directional
Zapier
app. You can send data from your apps and tools to your chatbot. And also query your chatbot from various Zapier integrations like Slack and SMS. See more details here:
https://customgpt.ai/chatgpt-zapier/
Can I use CustomGPT to build my own ChatGPT bot for my website?
Yes, you can use CustomGPT to build your own ChatGPT bot for your website. CustomGPT provides an easy no-code app that let’s non-technical users create their own bot with their website content or documents. You can feed the AI your content to fit your specific use case, enabling the bot to interact with your website visitors, answer their queries, and provide personalized recommendations, enhancing user experience and engagement.
What does the term "ChatGPT powered" mean in the context of CustomGPT?
“ChatGPT powered” in the context of CustomGPT means that our chatbot utilizes the advanced AI capabilities of ChatGPT.

Use Cases
What are the benefits of using CustomGPT for my business?
CustomGPT provides numerous benefits for your business by using your business data to build a custom ChatGPT-style chatbot.
The biggest use case emerging currently (across our thousands of customers) is:
Employee efficiency
. Customers are seeing huge improvements in employee productivity by having custom chatbots based on their own data and content.
The next major use case is
Customer Experience
. Instead of forcing customers to waste time browsing through the website or painful processes, a custom chatbot with your own content/data leads to much better customer experience and engagement.
This leads to growing revenue and lowering costs with
secure and privacy-preserving
platform.
Think about it : What if ChatGPT knew about
all your business content
? How would customers and employees benefit from it?
By having a custom AI chatbot that has ingested your specific data and information, your business can provide better customer experience and employee efficiency. Customers can interact with the chat widget on your website. Or even use the LiveChat option to engage with your content. Advanced users can use the API to integrate the chatbot functionality into their workflows.
What types of data and information can I use to train my CustomGPT chatbot?
CustomGPT is designed to work with a wide range of data and information, including text-based data such as website content, customer inquiries, product descriptions, FAQs, and more. We support 1400+ document formats including PDF files, Microsoft Office docs, Google docs and more that can be ingested into the chatbot. We have now added support for
Youtube / Vimeo videos
and audio/podcasts.
You can also add other business-specific information from
multiple sources
to your chatbot. You can even ingest data via
Zapier
from your various apps and tools.
The more data you provide, the more accurate and effective your CustomGPT chatbot will be in delivering the results you need for your business.
How is CustomGPT different from other AI chatbots or language models?
CustomGPT is based on
your business content
. This results in
trusted
responses based on your business – not generic responses you would see in ChatGPT.
CustomGPT is powered by the same advanced AI language models (LLMs) that power OpenAI’s ChatGPT, so you get the latest in AI technology. And since it has ingested your data, it can generate more accurate and relevant responses,
without hallucinations – that is, making up facts.
This enhances the overall performance and personalization, allowing your business to benefit from improved employee efficiency and customer experience.
As AI technologies continue to advance, we will automatically include the latest AI technology in all CustomGPT chatbots, so you can benefit from the latest AI technology always and automatically!
How can I use my custom chatbot for customer service, marketing, or other business operations?
CustomGPT can be used in a variety of ways to improve your business operations. Some of the most common use cases include customer service, marketing and helpdesk. But just ask yourself: What if ChatGPT knew
all my business content
? The list of use cases emerging on a daily basis is simply mind-boggling
The most straightforward way is to embed the chatbot into your website, either as a widget or as a LiveChat option. This lets your visitors engage with your business content and get quick accurate answers at any time, rather than waiting hours for a live agent.
The other common way is to have
employees
use the chatbot privately via the secure dashboard. To ensure the
security and privacy of your data
, the default behavior is private.
CustomGPT can also be integrated into your existing systems and processes using the API, allowing you to take advantage of the insights and knowledge that it has acquired from your data to improve your operations and create a more effective and efficient business.
Can CustomGPT be integrated with my existing systems or platforms?
Yes, CustomGPT API is included in all the
plans

How It Works
What kind of support and resources does CustomGPT provide for customers?
CustomGPT provides a range of support and resources for its customers. This includes access to our online knowledge base, as well as
email support
from our customer service team.

asking CustomGPT
using our website widget. Anything you see on the website is now a question away.
Additionally, for enterprise customers, we offer training and onboarding services to help you get the most out of your custom chatbot. We also provide ongoing updates and improvements to our platform to ensure you always have access to the latest technology and information about the same.
Are there any limitations or restrictions to using CustomGPT and chatbot?
The chatbot’s performance and accuracy is impacted by the quality and volume of the data it is trained on, so it’s important to regularly review and update your training data as needed.
Additionally, CustomGPT is a cloud-based subscription platform and there are limitations to the amount of data we ingest (based on your plan) and number of queries your chatbot can handle in any given month, based on your
subscription plan
. Finally, relevant laws and regulations apply, and customers are responsible for ensuring their use of the chatbot is in compliance with these regulations.
How long does it take CustomGPT to ingest my data?
On average, it takes a few minutes to fully index your data.
The exact time it takes will depend on the amount and type of data. File processing is quick (seconds). Website crawling could take longer (minutes or hours depending on the speed and size of your website). Most small business bots build in less than 5 mins.
Is CustomGPT secure and privacy-compliant?
Yes. Your data is fully encrypted and files are stored only when you choose to. Files are encrypted in transit, and encrypted at rest. We use secure vendors like AWS and Stripe. See our full list of
security principles
.
Moreover, your chatbot is fully-self contained, which means it does not share ANY data with other chatbots, even within your own account.
And by default, your chatbot is private, which means only authorized users can query your chatbot. We understand the importance of your data security and privacy and are fully committed to ensure that the chatbot and your data are secure, confidential and private.

What pricing plan do I need?
You can select a
pricing plan
to meet your business need based on the
amount of data
you want to utilize, and number of CustomGPT chatbot
queries
you want to offer per month.
A good rule of thumb: 10M words is about 50MB of data (your actual words might vary!)
It is recommended to sign up for a higher plan and then adjust later because indexing will stop immediately when you hit your plan limits.
For pricing purposes, what is a "agent"?
An agent is basically a single chatbot. The chatbot is a self-contained ChatGPT chatbot trained on your data. Our standard $99 plan lets you have 10 active chatbots and higher pricing plans support more.
So, for example: You could create one chatbot with your website content. And create a separate chatbot with your support documents for internal use.
You can delete unused chatbots to stay within your plan limits. This let’s you create “throwaway” chatbots for quick use.
For pricing purposes, what is an "page"?
A “page” is basically a single resource like a “webpage”, “document”, “file”, “video” or “audio”.
Our standard $99 plan lets you create chatbots with up to 5000 “pages”. This could mean 5000 webpages. Or 5000 uploaded documents. Or a mix of webpages, documents or videos.
So, for example: You could create a chatbot with your website content which has 3250 webpages. Then add 1000 documents from your support team. Then add 750 Youtube videos. This would make it 3250 + 1000 + 750 = 5000 “pages”
Important: When your chatbot hits the plan’s “pages” limit, the system will stop crawling and processing your “pages”.  And you will see the “LIMITED” icon in your crawl status page. It is recommended to sign up for the correct plan depending on the number of “pages” your business needs.
One common misconception:
If your PDF file has 100 pages, it counts as 1 “page” in our system, not 100.
Are the plan limits per agent? Or across the full account?
The plan limits are across the entire account. For example: If you sign up for the $99/month plan, you can store 60 million words across 10 “agents”. This allows you to share your plan limits across the 10 agents.
It is recommended to sign up for the correct plan based upon the total data you plan on indexing.
Do you have an affiliate program?
Yes – please see information about our
partner program
.
How can I change my account email, name or password?
To change your email, name or password in CustomGPT, please log in to your account and navigate to the “Account Settings” section. There you will find options to update your email, name and password. If you encounter any issues, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance at
hello@customgpt.ai
How can I reset my password if I have forgotten it and cannot access my account?
From the Login page, select the “Forgot password?” option to reset your password.
I have deleted documents from my chatbot. Why is my words-indexed limit not resetting?
The words-indexed limit does not reset when files are deleted. Every file that you upload to your account counts towards your words-indexed limit.

How do I upload podcasts?
To learn how you can easily upload podcast episodes or a  podcast feed, see the
Step-By-Step Guide
.
Do I need to really need to Upload my audio?
You don’t
need
to. In fact, You can just point our system to the URL of the podcast audio. That is the preferred method and saves you the trouble of downloading and uploading.
What kinds of podcasts can I upload?
You can upload any and all kinds of podcasts. From 3 minutes to 3 hours, CustomGPT will index your podcast episodes and within minutes, your chatbot will be fully equipped with the knowledge from your podcasts.
What are the benefits of sourcing my chatbot data from podcasts?
1. With your podcasts transformed into text, you can easily search and find specific topics or segments, making your content highly accessible and user-friendly.

3. Your podcast chatbot is a content generation machine. It can create blog posts, social media snippets, FAQs, and more, continuously providing fresh content to keep your audience engaged.
How does the speech-to-text work?
Using OpenAI’s automatic speech recognition (ASR) system called OpenAI Whisper, trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web, your chatbot can transcribe audio regardless of accents, background noise, and technical language.
Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English.
How does the CustomGPT chatbot access the information in my podcasts?
The chatbot ingests and transcribes the content of your podcast content. This transcription then serves as a knowledge base from which the chatbot can draw to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses —
without making up facts
.
Is any technical knowledge required to use the platform?
Nope! Building a chatbot from podcast episodes or feeds requires no programming. It is a completely no-code platform.
How accurate and specific are the details provided by the chatbot?
The chatbot responds with information directly from the audio content, ensuring that answers to queries are relevant and correct – without making up facts.
CustomGPT puts a rock-solid context boundary around your content and ensures that ChatGPT answers questions based on your content only. In other words: No hallucinations.
How long does it take to deploy the chatbot after uploading podcasts?
With realtime deployment, once you upload the desired podcasts, the chatbot can be deployed within minutes. After your podcasts have been indexed, the ‘Pages’ tab in CustomGPT will show you the index status of your files.

Step-By-Step Guide
or by using this
free online tool
.
Can I index both individual podcast episodes and entire podcast feeds?
Yes. You can make a chatbot using both episodes and feeds. Y
ou can create a sitemap with a list of individual episodes.
And then also have a separate sitemap from your feed.
With CustomGPT’s multi-source
data integration
system, you can mix-and-match what you build your chatbot with.
How do I obtain my podcasting show’s RSS feed?
RSS is a web feed that allows users to access updates to websites, like newly released podcast episodes, in a standardized, computer-readable format.
Using this free tool,
https://getrssfeed.com/
, getting the RSS feed for a podcast show only requires the easily attainable web link for the show. The link to the show can be found by navigating to any site that contains your show (Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, etc.) and finding a link.
This can usually be done by clicking the share button and usually, there will be an option for ‘copy link’. Once you have the link to the podcast show, simply copy and paste it into the
free tool.
How do I get the audio file for a podcast episode?
The platform supports various audio file formats, including ‘.mp3’, ‘.mp4’, ‘.mpeg’, ‘.mpga’, ‘.m4a’, ‘.wav’, and ‘.webm’. Users can upload podcast episodes in any of these formats.
If you don’t know where your podcast audio link is, here is a
comprehensive guide
to obtaining an mp3 URL from a podcast episode webpage.
I have audio files. Does this work on any audio?
Aha – in fact, yes! If your audio file is in one of the supported formats, you can actually use the
Upload
option and build your chatbot based on what is being said in the audio.
While this feature does say “podcasts”, it works with any audio file. So you can build  chatbot with your Zoom meeting audio or that song you sang (woohoo!)

Precisávamos de uma plataforma de IA Generativa que fornecesse respostas confiáveis com base em nosso próprio conteúdo sem problemas de alucinação.
Doug Williams, Líder de Produto, Centro Martin Trust para Empreendedorismo do MIT
O chatbot ChatGPT é treinado com todas as informações e conteúdos do nosso negócio e entende as necessidades e preferências dos nossos clientes como nenhum humano poderia.
Venkat Kolluri, Cidewalk
A satisfação do cliente disparou. Nossos clientes e equipe de suporte agora têm respostas instantâneas baseadas no conteúdo do nosso helpdesk. Até indexamos nosso canal do YouTube e podcasts.
Mike Moloney, Filtergrade
Adoro que o CustomGPT tenha resolvido o problema das 'alucinações' da IA. A ideia de que a IA invente coisas é francamente assustadora. Mas com respostas confiáveis e fontes, os casos de uso da IA são emocionantes novamente!
Julie Winkle Giulioni, Autora
Amamos poder carregar nossos manuais de RH e ter o CustomGPT respondendo exatamente a partir desse conteúdo, sem inventar coisas.
Matthew Karp, IA em RH

Primeiros Passos
O que é CustomGPT e como funciona?
O CustomGPT cria seu próprio chatbot ChatGPT personalizado com todo o conteúdo do seu negócio. Você obtém respostas precisas e confiáveis do ChatGPT a partir do seu conteúdo, sem inventar fatos. Tudo dentro de uma plataforma segura, com foco na privacidade e de nível empresarial.

Nossa plataforma
segura e preservadora de privacidade
então absorve esse conteúdo e usa essas informações para responder a consultas com o ChatGPT.
O resultado é um bot estilo ChatGPT personalizado que pode ter um profundo entendimento do seu negócio e clientes, permitindo fornecer respostas personalizadas e precisas,
sem alucinações
, a uma ampla gama de consultas. Este bot pode então ser incorporado ao seu site, usado como um LiveChat ou integrado aos seus sistemas via API.

Você pode fornecer o conteúdo e os dados do seu negócio para o CustomGPT de várias maneiras, usando a interface do CustomGPT para o seu projeto.
Você pode fornecer o sitemap do seu site ou criar um
sitemap personalizado
, com o qual o CustomGPT pode indexar todo o conteúdo do seu site e atualizá-lo periodicamente para verificar se há conteúdo novo.

Novo: Agora você também pode misturar e
combinar dados de várias fontes
para criar uma “fonte da verdade” com o seu chatbot.

este exemplo
de um chatbot de marca.
Você pode
personalizar
o logotipo, cor de fundo ou imagem para se alinhar com a identidade visual da sua marca. Você também pode personalizar o idioma do Chatbot e a fonte padrão usada pelo Chatbot para fornecer respostas.
Novo: E agora, os planos “Premium” e “Empresarial” podem remover a marcação “Powered by CustomGPT” para uma verdadeira experiência de white-label / revenda.
Atualização: E agora com nossa nova
API
, você pode criar dinamicamente chatbots e revendê-los para seus clientes.

upload dos seus documentos
em mais de 1400 formatos, incluindo PDFs, documentos do Microsoft Office e Google Docs.

Não sou técnico. Posso apenas fazer upload dos meus documentos e construir o bot?
Sim, você pode simplesmente acessar seu painel CustomGPT e fazer upload dos documentos para construir seus chatbots personalizados em minutos! O CustomGPT é uma ferramenta de construção de chatbots ChatGPT sem código, que não requer conhecimento técnico.
Posso construir um Chatbot para Inteligência Competitiva?
Sim, você pode fazer upload do sitemap do seu concorrente e usar isso para obter insights competitivos. Você pode até fazer
upload de documentos
ou
adicionar dados de várias fontes
para construir uma “fonte da verdade” consolidada sobre seu concorrente.
O CustomGPT pode ler e entender tabelas em arquivos PDF?
O CustomGPT lê o texto das tabelas (em arquivos PDF e Excel/CSV). No entanto, observe: o ChatGPT (e CustomGPT) não é muito bom em análises e matemática. Então, se o seu caso de uso estiver relacionado a contagens e análises, o CustomGPT pode não ser a melhor escolha.
No entanto, qualquer coisa relacionada à busca de conteúdo nas tabelas e, em seguida, criar respostas em texto com base nisso, deve funcionar muito bem.
Como integro o CustomGPT ao meu aplicativo usando a chave da API? Onde está a documentação da API?
A documentação sobre o uso da API CustomGPT está disponível no seguinte link:
https://docs.customgpt.ai/reference/quickstart-guide
Posso fazer upload de vários formatos de arquivo como .pdf, .xls e outros para o CustomGPT analisar?
Sim, o CustomGPT suporta 1400 formatos de arquivo, incluindo PDF, documentos do Microsoft Office, Google Docs, arquivos de texto e arquivos de Áudio/Vídeo.
Como posso treinar o CustomGPT com meu conteúdo ou dados específicos?
Sim, você pode fazer upload de arquivos específicos e sitemaps com URLs específicas para treinar seus chatbots CustomGPT.
Vocês têm uma API?

). Mais guias e livros de receitas devem estar a caminho em breve.
Vocês oferecem um teste gratuito?
Infelizmente, não oferecemos testes gratuitos no momento, mas podemos adicionar testes gratuitos em alguns meses.
Atualmente, a demanda é muito alta e simplesmente não temos recursos para suportar testes gratuitos. Por favor, sinta-se à vontade para conferir
nossa demonstração
em
https://customgpt.ai/demo
ou o Livechat no canto inferior direito deste site.
Vocês têm um App Zapier?

Você pode alimentar a IA com seu conteúdo para se adequar ao seu caso de uso específico, permitindo que o bot interaja com os visitantes do seu site, responda às suas consultas e forneça recomendações personalizadas, aprimorando a experiência e o engajamento do usuário.
O que significa "impulsionado por ChatGPT" no contexto do CustomGPT?
“Impulsionado por ChatGPT” no contexto do CustomGPT significa que nosso chatbot utiliza as capacidades avançadas de IA do ChatGPT-4. Ele absorve seus dados, incluindo conteúdo do site, helpdesk, bases de conhecimento, documentos e mais, para responder com precisão às consultas. Isso resulta em um chatbot personalizado que entende as peculiaridades do seu negócio, aprimorando tanto a eficiência dos funcionários quanto a experiência do cliente.
Como um ChatGPT personalizado para negócios é diferente do site regular do ChatGPT?
Um ChatGPT personalizado para negócios é adaptado às suas necessidades específicas de negócio. É impulsionado pelo ChatGPT-4 e fornece respostas precisas baseadas no conteúdo do seu negócio. Ele suporta 92 idiomas, integra-se a várias fontes de dados e pode ser incorporado no seu site. Ele não inventa fatos ou alucina, garantindo interações confiáveis e de confiança. Também é seguro e prioriza a privacidade, tornando-o adequado para aplicações de nível empresarial.
Qual é a diferença entre um bot personalizado e um chatbot de IA genérico?
Um bot personalizado, como o CustomGPT, é adaptado às suas necessidades específicas de negócio. É impulsionado por IA avançada, fornece respostas precisas baseadas no conteúdo do seu negócio e suporta vários idiomas. Ele se integra a várias fontes de dados e pode ser incorporado ao seu site. Um chatbot de IA genérico, por outro lado, oferece recursos e respostas padrão que não são personalizados para o seu negócio. Ele pode não suportar vários idiomas ou integrar-se perfeitamente com suas fontes de dados.
Como funciona o recurso "faça seu próprio chatbot" no CustomGPT?
O recurso “faça seu próprio chatbot” no CustomGPT funciona absorvendo seus dados, incluindo conteúdo do site, helpdesk, bases de conhecimento, documentos e mais. Ele usa essas informações para permitir que o ChatGPT-4 responda às consultas. O resultado é um chatbot impulsionado pelo ChatGPT personalizado que entende as peculiaridades do seu negócio. A configuração é super fácil e leva cerca de 2 minutos.
Existem versões de demonstração ou demonstrações do chatgpt4 disponíveis para testar as capacidades do CustomGPT?
Sim, por favor, veja a demonstração ao vivo em:
https://customgpt.ai/demo/
Como o CustomGPT pode ajudar a criar uma experiência de chatbot pessoal?
O CustomGPT cria uma experiência de chatbot pessoal absorvendo os dados do seu negócio, incluindo conteúdo do site, helpdesk, bases de conhecimento, documentos e mais. Isso permite que o chatbot impulsionado pelo ChatGPT-4 entenda as peculiaridades dos seus produtos, serviços e clientes. O resultado é um chatbot único e personalizado que fornece respostas precisas e confiáveis com base no conteúdo do seu negócio, aprimorando tanto a eficiência dos funcionários quanto a experiência do cliente.
Qual é a diferença entre um chatbot de IA GPT e outras tecnologias de chatbot?
Um chatbot de IA GPT, como o ChatGPT, difere de outras tecnologias de chatbot em suas capacidades avançadas de processamento de linguagem natural e aprendizado de máquina. Ele entende e responde à linguagem humana com mais precisão e aprende a partir de cada interação para melhorar as respostas. Diferente de muitos chatbots, ele pode lidar com consultas complexas e fornecer recomendações personalizadas. O CustomGPT utiliza essa tecnologia avançada do ChatGPT e a combina com o seu conteúdo único para adaptá-la às necessidades específicas do seu negócio.
Casos de Uso
Quais são os benefícios de usar o CustomGPT para o meu negócio?
O CustomGPT oferece inúmeros benefícios para o seu negócio ao usar os dados da sua empresa para construir um chatbot estilo ChatGPT personalizado.
O maior caso de uso que está surgindo atualmente (entre nossos milhares de clientes) é:
Eficiência dos funcionários
. Os clientes estão vendo grandes melhorias na produtividade dos funcionários ao terem chatbots personalizados baseados em seus próprios dados e conteúdo.
O próximo grande caso de uso é a
Experiência do Cliente
. Em vez de forçar os clientes a perderem tempo navegando pelo site ou processos dolorosos, um chatbot personalizado com o seu próprio conteúdo/dados leva a uma experiência e engajamento do cliente muito melhores.
Isso leva ao crescimento da receita e à redução dos custos com uma plataforma
segura e que preserva a privacidade
.
Pense nisso: E se o ChatGPT soubesse de
todo o conteúdo do seu negócio?
Como clientes e funcionários se beneficiariam disso?
Ao ter um chatbot de IA personalizado que absorveu seus dados e informações específicas, seu negócio pode proporcionar uma melhor experiência ao cliente e eficiência dos funcionários. Os clientes podem interagir com o widget de chat no seu site. Ou até usar a opção de LiveChat para se engajar com o seu conteúdo. Usuários avançados podem usar a API para integrar a funcionalidade do chatbot em seus fluxos de trabalho.
Quais tipos de dados e informações posso usar para treinar meu chatbot CustomGPT?
O CustomGPT é projetado para trabalhar com uma ampla gama de dados e informações, incluindo dados baseados em texto, como conteúdo de sites, consultas de clientes, descrições de produtos, FAQs e mais. Suportamos mais de 1400 formatos de documentos, incluindo arquivos PDF, documentos do Microsoft Office, Google docs e mais que podem ser ingeridos no chatbot. Agora adicionamos suporte para
vídeos do Youtube/Vimeo
e áudio/podcasts.
Você também pode adicionar outras informações específicas do seu negócio de
várias fontes
ao seu chatbot. Você pode até ingerir dados via
Zapier
dos seus vários aplicativos e ferramentas.
Quanto mais dados você fornecer, mais preciso e eficaz será o seu chatbot CustomGPT na entrega dos resultados que você precisa para o seu negócio.
Como o CustomGPT é diferente de outros chatbots de IA ou modelos de linguagem?
O CustomGPT é baseado no
conteúdo do seu negócio
. Isso resulta em respostas
confiáveis
baseadas no seu negócio – não em respostas genéricas que você veria no ChatGPT.
O CustomGPT é impulsionado pelos mesmos modelos avançados de linguagem de IA (LLMs) que alimentam o ChatGPT-4 da OpenAI, então você obtém o que há de mais recente em tecnologia de IA. E, como ele absorveu seus dados, pode gerar respostas mais precisas e relevantes,
sem alucinações – ou seja, sem inventar fatos.
Isso aprimora o desempenho geral e a personalização, permitindo que seu negócio se beneficie de uma maior eficiência dos funcionários e uma melhor experiência do cliente.
À medida que as tecnologias de IA continuam avançando, automaticamente incluiremos a tecnologia de IA mais recente em todos os chatbots CustomGPT, para que você possa sempre e automaticamente se beneficiar da tecnologia de IA mais recente!
Como posso usar meu chatbot personalizado para atendimento ao cliente, marketing ou outras operações de negócios?
O CustomGPT pode ser usado de várias maneiras para melhorar suas operações de negócios. Alguns dos casos de uso mais comuns incluem atendimento ao cliente, marketing e helpdesk. Mas basta se perguntar: E se o ChatGPT conhecesse
todo o conteúdo do meu negócio?
A lista de casos de uso que surge diariamente é simplesmente impressionante.
A maneira mais direta é incorporar o chatbot no seu site, seja como um widget ou como uma opção de LiveChat. Isso permite que seus visitantes interajam com o conteúdo do seu negócio e obtenham respostas rápidas e precisas a qualquer momento, em vez de esperar horas por um agente ao vivo.
Outra maneira comum é ter
funcionários
usando o chatbot privadamente através do painel seguro. Para garantir a
segurança e privacidade dos seus dados
, o comportamento padrão é privado.
O CustomGPT também pode ser integrado aos seus sistemas e processos existentes usando a API, permitindo que você aproveite os insights e conhecimentos que adquiriu dos seus dados para melhorar suas operações e criar um negócio mais eficaz e eficiente.
O CustomGPT pode ser integrado aos meus sistemas ou plataformas existentes?
Sim, a API do CustomGPT está incluída em todos os
planos
. Você pode usar a
API
para construir programaticamente o chatbot e consultá-lo para integrar a tecnologia de IA generativa aos seus sistemas e plataformas existentes e até construir aplicativos.
Usando
nosso aplicativo Zapier
, você pode atualmente integrar a API em mais de 5000 sistemas.
Quais idiomas são suportados pelo CustomGPT?
No momento, suportamos 93
idiomas
, incluindo: Árabe, Awadhi, Azerbaijano, Bashkir, Bielorrusso, Búlgaro, Bhojpuri, Bengali, Bósnio, Catalão, Mandarim, Tcheco, Galês, Dinamarquês, Alemão, Dogri, Grego, Inglês, Espanhol, Estoniano, Basco, Persa (Farsi), Finlandês, Feroês, Francês, Irlandês, Galego, Gujarati, Hindi, Chhattisgarhi, Croata, Haryanvi, Húngaro, Hebraico, Armênio, Indonésio, Italiano, Japonês, Javanês, Georgiano, Cazaque, Canarês, Coreano, Konkani, Caxemira, Quirguiz, Lituano, Letão, Maithili, Montenegrino, Macedônio, Mongol, Moldávio, Marathi, Malaio, Maltês, Marwari, Min Nan, Nepali, Holandês, Norueguês, Oriya, Punjabi, Polonês, Pashto, Português, Português Brasileiro, Rajasthani, Romeno, Russo, Sânscrito, Santali, Sindhi, Cingalês, Eslovaco, Esloveno, Albanês, Sérvio, Sueco, Swahili, Tâmil, Telugu, Tadjique, Tailandês, Turcomeno, Turco, Tártaro, Ucraniano, Urdu, Uzbeque, Vietnamita, Wu, Cantonês (Yue)
Vocês usam OpenAI / ChatGPT?
Sim, usamos o LLM da OpenAI (chamado “ada”) e o ChatGPT-4.
POR FAVOR, OBSERVE: Ao contrário dos nossos concorrentes,
não suportamos
o ChatGPT 3.5. Acreditamos firmemente que para casos de uso de negócios reais, como anti-alucinações e respostas confiáveis com citações, o
ChatGPT-4
é essencial.
Parece legal. O que posso fazer com o CustomGPT?
Uma vez que você construir o seu bot CustomGPT, você pode usá-lo para agregar valor real ao seu negócio:
Incorpore-o em seu site, para fornecer atendimento ao cliente e/ou substituir a experiência de busca legada. Deixe seus clientes terem conversas reais com o conteúdo do seu negócio.
Veja este exemplo
.
LiveChat para o seu site: Deixe seus clientes obterem respostas rápidas com base no conteúdo do seu negócio, onde quer que esse conteúdo esteja. Imagine só os clientes obtendo respostas instantâneas com base no seu site, helpdesk, manuais, documentos, vídeos, podcasts, etc. Chega de dizer “Olá” e esperar horas por um agente. Veja o nosso widget de livechat no canto inferior direito desta página.
Integrações de Fluxo de Trabalho: Imagine só seus processos de negócios obtendo respostas rápidas com base nos dados do seu negócio. Use a API do CustomGPT para integrar ao Slack, HubSpot ou mais de 5000 integrações com o
Zapier
. Sentindo-se aventureiro? Agora você pode até
construir seu chatbot
usando a API – imagine todos os aplicativos que você pode construir com isso.
Posso colocar o chatbot no meu próprio site?
Absolutamente. Você pode incorporar o bot CustomGPT em seu site, usá-lo como um agente LiveChat e até usar a API para integrá-lo aos seus aplicativos e sistemas.
O CustomGPT lembra de conversas anteriores ou entradas de usuários?
Sim – o CustomGPT tem conversas completas, turno a turno, semelhantes ao que você vê no ChatGPT. Então, você pode usá-lo para construir prompts ricos, bem como prompts de “cadeia de pensamento” que ajudam a trabalhar através de um problema.
O CustomGPT pode ajudar com tarefas de análise de dados ou geração de código?
O CustomGPT utiliza as APIs do ChatGPT-4 para seu serviço. Os principais casos de uso do CustomGPT são para responder a perguntas e fornecer insights com base no conteúdo empresarial. Portanto, embora seja possível selecionando a fonte de resposta como “Meu Conteúdo + ChatGPT”, a geração de código não é um caso de uso principal do CustomGPT.
O CustomGPT pode ser usado para criar conteúdo em vários idiomas?
Sim, o CustomGPT suporta 92 idiomas populares. Eu posso entender seu conteúdo nesses idiomas, bem como responder perguntas nesses diferentes idiomas.
O idioma é um aspecto chave do ChatGPT. Realizamos testes em que o ChatGPT pode receber conteúdo em árabe, em seguida, ser feita uma pergunta em alemão e depois pedir para responder em japonês. Tudo isso em uma única consulta do usuário.
O CustomGPT funciona com indústrias específicas, como finanças, saúde ou marketing?
A solução CustomGPT funciona para conteúdo em todas as indústrias. Como se espera que o conteúdo carregado por uma organização seja adaptado aos domínios nos quais operam, as respostas do CustomGPT serão igualmente adaptadas com base no conteúdo.
O que é um chatbot ChatGPT e como ele pode beneficiar o meu negócio?
Um chatbot impulsionado pelo ChatGPT é um chatbot de IA que aprende com o seu conteúdo e permite que os clientes interajam com ele. Pode agilizar as interações com os clientes, reduzir custos operacionais e fornecer recomendações personalizadas. Disponível 24/7, pode gerenciar altos volumes de consultas e fornecer insights baseados em dados para uma melhor tomada de decisão. Implementar um chatbot ChatGPT personalizado pode melhorar significativamente a eficiência e a satisfação do cliente do seu negócio.
Como funciona a integração do site ChatGPT com o CustomGPT?
O ChatGPT pode ser integrado ao seu site usando os práticos widgets de incorporação e livechat do CustomGPT. O processo envolve configurar o chatbot, personalizá-lo para a sua marca e incorporá-lo ao código do site. Isso permite que o chatbot interaja com os visitantes do site, responda às suas consultas e forneça recomendações personalizadas. A integração permite uma comunicação em tempo real e sem interrupções, aprimorando a experiência e o engajamento do usuário no site.
Como um ChatGPT personalizado para negócios difere de outras soluções de chatbot?
Um ChatGPT personalizado para negócios difere de outras soluções de chatbot em sua capacidade de entender o seu conteúdo único e responder perguntas baseadas nele, sem alucinações ou invenções. Essa confiança e segurança da marca aumentam a satisfação do cliente com respostas precisas para o seu negócio.
O que torna o chatbot personalizável do CustomGPT único para empresas?
As respostas do CustomGPT são baseadas no conteúdo do seu negócio, garantindo precisão e relevância. O CustomGPT é líder em anti-alucinação, garantindo que a IA sempre responda a partir do seu conteúdo, protegendo assim a confiança e a integridade da sua marca.
Como as empresas podem aproveitar os recursos do ChatGPT através do CustomGPT?
As empresas podem aproveitar os recursos do ChatGPT através do CustomGPT criando um chatbot personalizado que entende e processa o seu conteúdo único. Esse chatbot usa os dados do seu negócio para fornecer respostas precisas e relevantes, aprimorando a experiência do cliente e a eficiência dos funcionários. Ele pode automatizar tarefas repetitivas, fornecer respostas rápidas para consultas e facilitar a comunicação fluida entre membros da equipe que falam idiomas diferentes. Isso leva a um maior engajamento do cliente, produtividade aprimorada e uma vantagem competitiva.
Quais são as vantagens de usar um chatbot empresarial impulsionado pelo ChatGPT?
Um chatbot empresarial impulsionado pelo ChatGPT automatiza tarefas como atendimento ao cliente e vendas, melhorando a eficiência. É econômico, eliminando a necessidade de equipes de IA caras. Poupa tempo ao aprender o seu conteúdo, reduzindo a necessidade de leitura manual de documentos. Aumenta a precisão, pois é baseado nos seus dados. Também aprimora a experiência do cliente ao fornecer respostas instantâneas e personalizadas na voz da sua marca, até mesmo em outros idiomas. Isso leva a um aumento de receita e redução de custos.
O CustomGPT pode ajudar a transformar o conteúdo do meu podcast em uma experiência de chatbot?
Absolutamente! O CustomGPT pode transformar o conteúdo do seu podcast em uma experiência de chatbot. Ele indexa seus episódios de podcast, convertendo o áudio em texto usando o OpenAI Whisper. Isso permite que o chatbot forneça respostas instantâneas às consultas do usuário com base no conteúdo do seu podcast. É como dar uma voz ao seu podcast para conversar com seus ouvintes. Isso não apenas aprimora o engajamento do usuário, mas também torna o seu conteúdo altamente acessível e fácil de usar.
Por que as empresas devem considerar a plataforma CustomGPT em vez de outras opções de chatbot para sites?
O CustomGPT oferece uma plataforma segura de nível empresarial com especialização em respostas precisas a partir do seu conteúdo sem alucinações (ou seja, sem inventar fatos). Nosso algoritmo líder de mercado em anti-alucinação, juntamente com melhorias como citações/fontes, faz do CustomGPT um possível divisor de águas para as interações com clientes do seu negócio.
Como Funciona
Que tipo de suporte e recursos o CustomGPT oferece para os clientes?
O CustomGPT oferece uma gama de suporte e recursos para seus clientes. Isso inclui acesso à nossa base de conhecimento online, bem como
suporte por e-mail
de nossa equipe de atendimento ao cliente.
Mas espere: Usamos nosso próprio sistema para fornecer um repositório de conhecimento completo para o nosso negócio. Em vez de e-mail tradicional, experimente
perguntar ao CustomGPT

Existem limitações ou restrições ao usar o CustomGPT e o chatbot?
O desempenho e a precisão do chatbot são impactados pela qualidade e volume dos dados em que é treinado, por isso é importante revisar e atualizar regularmente seus dados de treinamento conforme necessário.
Além disso, o CustomGPT é uma plataforma baseada em nuvem com assinatura e há limitações na quantidade de dados que ingerimos (baseados no seu plano) e no número de consultas que seu chatbot pode lidar em um determinado mês, com base no seu
plano de assinatura
. Por fim, leis e regulamentos relevantes se aplicam, e os clientes são responsáveis por garantir que o uso do chatbot esteja em conformidade com essas regulamentações.
Quanto tempo o CustomGPT leva para ingerir meus dados?
Em média, leva alguns minutos para indexar totalmente seus dados.
O tempo exato dependerá da quantidade e do tipo de dados. O processamento de arquivos é rápido (segundos). A varredura de sites pode levar mais tempo (minutos ou horas, dependendo da velocidade e tamanho do seu site). A maioria dos bots de pequenas empresas é construída em menos de 5 minutos.
O CustomGPT é seguro e em conformidade com a privacidade?
Sim. Seus dados são totalmente criptografados e os arquivos são armazenados apenas quando você escolhe. Os arquivos são criptografados em trânsito e em repouso. Usamos fornecedores seguros como AWS e Stripe. Veja nossa lista completa de
princípios de segurança
.
Além disso, seu chatbot é totalmente autossuficiente, o que significa que ele não compartilha NENHUM dado com outros chatbots, mesmo dentro da sua própria conta.
E por padrão, seu chatbot é privado, o que significa que apenas usuários autorizados podem consultar seu chatbot. Entendemos a importância da segurança e privacidade dos seus dados e estamos totalmente comprometidos em garantir que o chatbot e seus dados sejam seguros, confidenciais e privados.
Atualização:
E a partir de 1º de março de 2023, a OpenAI
confirmou
que
não usa seus dados
para fins de treinamento. Como usamos a API do ChatGPT, nenhuma parte dos seus dados será usada para fins de treinamento pela OpenAI.
Como é o suporte ao cliente para o CustomGPT?

A OpenAI usa meus dados para fins de treinamento?
A partir de 1º de março de 2023, a OpenAI
esclareceu
que
NÃO usa dados
de chamadas de API em seu treinamento. E como usamos a API do ChatGPT-4, seus dados e consultas NÃO são usados em nenhum treinamento de ML deles.
Existem limitações para o tamanho da saída ou resposta do CustomGPT?
Sim. Usamos a API do ChatGPT-4 que tem limites no tamanho da resposta, então a resposta para uma única consulta do usuário pode ter até cerca de 4500 palavras.
O CustomGPT pode ser conectado a outras plataformas, como Microsoft Teams ou sistemas de CRM?

Ouvi falar deste incidente de privacidade com a Samsung. Devo me preocupar?
Todos os dados carregados em um bot permanecem dentro desse silo. Eles nem mesmo são compartilhados com outros bots na mesma conta. Você pode ver nossos princípios de segurança aqui:
https://customgpt.ai/security/
Além disso, a OpenAI agora esclareceu que não usa dados de chamadas de API em seu treinamento (ou seja, o infame problema da Samsung!). Você pode ver:
O anúncio aqui:

Página de uso de dados da OpenAI:
https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies
Posso controlar o escopo das perguntas que os usuários podem fazer ao CustomGPT?
Não é possível controlar o texto inserido por um usuário no chatbot, no entanto, as respostas às perguntas podem ser controladas pela empresa/organização que implantou o chatbot CustomGPT.
Na verdade, o CustomGPT se orgulha de fornecer um limite de contexto sólido em torno do seu conteúdo empresarial, de modo que as respostas sejam provenientes das informações da sua organização. Por favor, veja:
https://customgpt.ai/hallucinations/
Posso fazer o bot se comportar de uma certa maneira e responder com base nas minhas personalizações?
Absolutamente – esta é uma excelente nova funcionalidade chamada “
Persona
“. Isso permite personalizar como o bot se comporta. Você pode ver mais detalhes aqui:
https://customgpt.ai/chatgpt-personas/
Dica Ninja: Criamos uma ferramenta gratuita que você pode usar chamada “
Make My Custom Instructions
” (E sim – esta ferramenta em si foi criada com o CustomGPT usando Personas)
Como podemos ter certeza de que nossos dados empresariais serão protegidos e não haverá violações de dados?
Levamos a proteção de dados a sério no CustomGPT. Nossas medidas de segurança incluem criptografia forte, controles de acesso e uma arquitetura de sistema robusta projetada para evitar acesso não autorizado ou violações de dados. Para um entendimento aprofundado de como garantimos a proteção de dados, por favor, consulte nossos princípios de segurança em
https://customgpt.ai/security/
. Estamos comprometidos em atualizar e melhorar regularmente nossas práticas de segurança para proteger eficazmente os dados do seu negócio.
Se você tiver alguma dúvida sobre privacidade ou segurança, por favor, consulte nosso
guia abrangente
em:
https://customgpt.ai/security-privacy-guide/
Como personalizo o bot ChatGPT usando sua plataforma?

Após fazer essas alterações, seu chatbot CustomGPT refletirá suas configurações selecionadas de UX e conversação. Para um guia detalhado, visite:
https://customgpt.ai/how-to-customize-the-appearance-and-language-of-your-customgpt-chatbot/
Posso fazer upload de documentos para o ChatGPT usando a plataforma CustomGPT?
Sim, você pode fazer upload de documentos para o ChatGPT usando a plataforma CustomGPT. Basta ir ao seu painel CustomGPT e fazer upload dos documentos para construir seus chatbots personalizados em minutos. Suportamos mais de 1400 formatos de documentos e a plataforma é construída para processar documentos de vários gigabytes. No entanto, cada arquivo não pode exceder 100MB neste momento. Se o seu arquivo for maior que isso, sugerimos usar um divisor de arquivos online para dividi-lo em arquivos menores.
Posso integrar meu bot empresarial no meu site diretamente do CustomGPT?
Com certeza! Você pode facilmente integrar seu bot empresarial do CustomGPT diretamente no seu site. Oferecemos opções de integração como widgets de site e LiveChat, garantindo uma experiência de usuário tranquila para seus clientes.

Posso usar o CustomGPT para construir chatbots para marketing de afiliados com as capacidades do ChatGPT?
Absolutamente! Você pode usar o CustomGPT para construir chatbots para marketing de afiliados.

Além disso, temos um Programa de Parceiros Afiliados que permite que você ganhe dinheiro promovendo o uso da nossa plataforma.
Como os chatbots de IA para negócios, especialmente os do CustomGPT, garantem precisão e relevância?
O CustomGPT garante precisão e relevância ao absorver o conteúdo do seu negócio e usar essas informações para responder a consultas. Ele é alimentado pelo ChatGPT-4 e pelo algoritmo anti-alucinação proprietário do CustomGPT, que geram respostas precisas e relevantes sem inventar fatos. Também implementamos uma parede de limite de contexto que garante que as respostas sejam derivadas exclusivamente do seu conteúdo empresarial, efetivamente bloqueando qualquer dado geral ou irrelevante da internet. Isso resulta em respostas confiáveis a partir do seu conteúdo.
Como o recurso de IA personalizável no CustomGPT melhora as interações com os usuários?
O recurso de IA personalizável no CustomGPT melhora as interações com os usuários ao permitir que você dê ao seu chatbot instruções personalizadas que se alinham às necessidades do seu negócio. Isso pode variar desde engajar um cliente até técnicas avançadas de IA, como detectar frustração. Ele ajuda a iniciar uma chamada para ação, facilita experiências mais humanas, distingue sua marca e oferece experiências excepcionais ao cliente. Este recurso não requer codificação, tornando-o acessível a todo usuário não técnico.
Quais são os passos envolvidos para criar seu próprio chatbot de IA usando a plataforma do CustomGPT?
Para criar seu próprio chatbot de IA usando a plataforma do CustomGPT, você fornece um link para o seu site ou faz upload de arquivos e documentos. Você pode até usar ambos os métodos. Isso permite que o chatbot seja personalizado de acordo com suas necessidades e preferências específicas.
Plano, Pagamentos, Faturamento
Como faço para atualizar ou mudar meu plano de assinatura?
Para atualizar ou mudar seu plano de assinatura, simplesmente faça login na sua conta CustomGPT e navegue até a página de
Faturamento
. Lá, você pode selecionar um novo plano que melhor atenda às suas necessidades e prosseguir com a atualização. A mudança no plano de assinatura terá efeito imediato.
Como cancelo minha assinatura?
Para cancelar sua assinatura do CustomGPT, siga estes passos:
Faça login na sua conta
Navegue até a seção “
Faturamento
”
Clique no botão “Cancelar Assinatura”
Siga as instruções para confirmar o cancelamento
Como atualizo minhas informações de faturamento?

Faturamento
”. Lá, você pode atualizar seu método de pagamento ou informações de faturamento conforme necessário. Usamos o Stripe para armazenar e gerenciar suas informações de faturamento de forma segura.
Como posso visualizar meu histórico de faturamento da assinatura?
Para visualizar seu histórico de faturamento da assinatura, faça login na sua conta CustomGPT e vá para a seção “
Faturamento
”. Aqui, você pode acessar todas as faturas e informações de pagamento relacionadas à sua assinatura.
Quais são as opções de pagamento disponíveis para minha assinatura?
Você pode fazer pagamentos para sua assinatura CustomGPT usando seu cartão de crédito. Suportamos transferências bancárias e faturamento ACH para clientes empresariais.
Como lido com problemas no pagamento da minha assinatura?
Você pode entrar em contato com a equipe de suporte ao cliente para obter ajuda com quaisquer problemas relacionados ao pagamento da sua assinatura. Eles poderão ajudá-lo a resolver o problema e responder a quaisquer perguntas que você tenha. Você pode alcançar a equipe de suporte ao cliente através da página “
Fale Conosco
”.
O que acontece se eu perder um pagamento da assinatura?
Se você perder um pagamento da assinatura devido a um cartão de crédito falho, seu serviço CustomGPT será suspenso e o chatbot deixará de responder às consultas. Após 30 dias, todos os seus dados serão excluídos. Para retomar o serviço, atualize o cartão de crédito o mais rápido possível. Se tiver dificuldades ou perguntas, entre em contato com nossa equipe de suporte ao cliente para obter ajuda.
Como recebo faturas pelos meus encargos de assinatura?
As faturas pelos seus encargos de assinatura são automaticamente enviadas pelo nosso processador de cartão de crédito, Stripe, para o e-mail associado à sua conta.
Existem descontos ou promoções disponíveis para minha assinatura?
Sim – temos um desconto de 10% para planos anuais.
Por favor, note: Devido à grande demanda, não temos testes gratuitos neste momento.
Como funciona a política de reembolso para minha assinatura?
Responsabilizamos nossos clientes por gerenciar suas contas, limites de crédito e excedentes. Reembolsos são aplicáveis apenas ao encargo atual da assinatura em sua conta, não a encargos excedentes do mês anterior. Observe que incorremos em custos significativos para indexar seu conteúdo e responder às consultas do chatbot.
Se você acredita que um reembolso é justificado, por favor responda diretamente para
hello@customgpt.ai
para iniciar a discussão sobre um possível reembolso. Pedimos que você cancele sua conta primeiro para processar um reembolso total e acelerar o processo de reembolso potencial.
Responderemos à sua solicitação dentro de 1-2 dias úteis. Seu pedido de reembolso será carimbado com data e hora e honrado quando você enviar seu e-mail. Agradecemos sua paciência e compreensão.
Qual plano de preços preciso?
Você pode selecionar um
plano de preços
para atender à necessidade do seu negócio com base na
quantidade de dados
que deseja utilizar e no número de
consultas
ao chatbot CustomGPT que deseja oferecer por mês.
Como regra geral: O plano de $49 é geralmente bom para até 50MB de dados (50MB é geralmente cerca de 10 milhões de palavras, a página web média tem geralmente 5000 palavras). Seu uso de dados pode variar (dependendo do tamanho das suas páginas web ou documentos).
Recomenda-se inscrever-se em um plano superior e ajustar mais tarde, pois a indexação será interrompida imediatamente quando você atingir os limites do seu plano.
Para fins de preços, o que é um "projeto"?
Um projeto é basicamente um único chatbot. O chatbot é um ChatGPT autossuficiente treinado com seus dados. Nosso plano padrão de $89 permite que você tenha 10 chatbots ativos e planos com preços mais altos suportam mais.
Então, por exemplo: Você pode criar um chatbot com o conteúdo do seu site. E criar um chatbot separado com seus documentos de suporte para uso interno.
Você pode excluir chatbots não utilizados para permanecer dentro dos limites do seu plano. Isso permite que você crie chatbots “descartáveis” para uso rápido.
Para fins de preços, o que é uma "página"?
Uma “página” é basicamente um único recurso, como uma “página web”, “documento”, “arquivo”, “vídeo” ou “áudio”. Nosso plano básico de $49 permite que você crie chatbots com até 1000 “páginas”. Isso pode significar 1000 páginas web. Ou 1000 documentos carregados. Ou uma mistura de páginas web, documentos ou vídeos.
Então, por exemplo: Você pode criar um chatbot com o conteúdo do seu site, que tem 532 páginas web. Depois adicionar 100 documentos da sua equipe de suporte. Em seguida, adicionar 50 vídeos do Youtube. Isso totalizaria 532 + 100 + 50 = 682 “páginas”.
Importante: Quando seu chatbot atingir o limite de “páginas” do plano, o sistema parará de rastrear e processar suas “páginas”. E você verá o ícone “LIMITADO” na sua página de status de rastreamento. Recomenda-se inscrever-se no plano correto, dependendo do número de “páginas” que seu negócio necessita.
Um equívoco comum:
Se o seu arquivo PDF tem 100 páginas, ele conta como 1 “página” em nosso sistema, não 100.
Os limites do plano são por projeto? Ou para toda a conta?
Os limites do plano são para toda a conta. Por exemplo: Se você se inscrever no plano de $49/mês, você pode indexar 10 milhões de palavras em 3 “projetos”. Isso permite que você compartilhe seus limites de plano entre os 3 projetos.
Recomenda-se inscrever-se no plano correto com base no total de dados que você planeja indexar.
Vocês têm um programa de afiliados?
Sim – por favor, veja informações sobre nosso
programa de parceiros
.
Como posso mudar meu e-mail, nome ou senha da conta?
Para mudar seu e-mail, nome ou senha no CustomGPT, faça login na sua conta e navegue até a seção “Configurações da Conta”. Lá você encontrará opções para atualizar seu e-mail, nome e senha. Se encontrar algum problema, não hesite em entrar em contato com nossa equipe de suporte para obter ajuda em
hello@customgpt.ai
Como posso redefinir minha senha se a esqueci e não consigo acessar minha conta?
Na página de Login, selecione a opção “Esqueceu a senha?” para redefinir sua senha.

Frequently Asked Questions
What are citations and sources in AI agents?
Citations and sources in AI agents

Can CustomGPT.ai handle multiple sources for a single response?
Yes, CustomGPT.ai can aggregate information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive response.

By referencing these custom data sources, CustomGPT.ai ensures that the agent responses are tailored to the specific information and knowledge base of your organization.
What happens when multiple documents are uploaded?
When multiple documents are uploaded
to CustomGPT.ai, the agent will show which documents were used in generating a response. Users can see a list of document names in the citations and, if configured to retain documents for viewing, can access these documents directly from the response. This feature is particularly useful for quick research and thorough
document review in fields like law
and research.
Can CustomGPT.ai understand the user’s context?

This leads to improved teamwork and more efficient project outcomes.
User Experience and Customization
This section answers queries about how citations improve user engagement and customization options available in CustomGPT.ai.

The visually informative citations also improve the overall engagement and usability of the platform.
Are citations available in all supported languages?
Yes, CustomGPT.ai supports citations in all
93 languages
it operates in. This feature ensures that users across different regions and language preferences receive accurate and reliable information. Providing citations in multiple languages enhances the inclusivity and accessibility of the agent, making it a valuable tool for global businesses.
What happens if a source is no longer available?
If a source is no longer available or has been moved, CustomGPT.ai can be configured to check for broken links and update or remove the affected citations. Regular updates to your data sources help prevent this issue, ensuring that the agent continues to provide accurate and reliable information.
How does CustomGPT.ai manage confidential information?
CustomGPT.ai can be configured to handle confidential or sensitive information with appropriate access controls and privacy settings. Citations for such information are managed to ensure compliance with data protection regulations. This ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users, maintaining confidentiality and trust.
How does CustomGPT.ai handle updates to sources?

auto-sync feature
ensures that changes made to your website, such as adding, deleting, or modifying pages, are automatically reflected in the bot’s knowledge base.
Can CustomGPT.ai provide citations for user-generated content?
Yes, CustomGPT.ai can include citations for user-generated content, such as comments, reviews, or forum posts, provided that this content is part of the ingested data. Proper referencing helps maintain transparency and credibility, ensuring users can verify the information from these sources.
How does CustomGPT.ai handle conflicting information?
CustomGPT.ai can be configured to prioritize certain sources over others to resolve conflicts.

This approach ensures that users receive a balanced view of the information, promoting informed decision-making.
What citation options are available for CustomGPT.ai agents?
It is possible to use in-line citations in the form of numbered references inside the agent’s response, collated references at the end of the response, or both at the same time.
What customization options are available for displaying citations?
CustomGPT offers several options for displaying citations: “User-Initiated,” “Always Show,” and “Always Hide.” “User-Initiated” shows citations only when requested by the user, “Always Show” displays citations automatically with each response, and “Always Hide” disables the display of citations. These options allow you to tailor the citation display according to your specific needs and preferences.
Is it possible to turn off the citation display?
Yes, you have complete control over the citation display settings. You can navigate to Settings > Chatbot Settings > Conversation Setting and adjust the settings to disable the citations if desired.
What are inline citations in the CustomGPT.ai agent?
Inline citations in the CustomGPT.ai agent are a new way to display the sources that the bot based its responses on. Instead of listing all sources at the end of the message, the bot uses numbered citations immediately after the sentences that reference them. This method allows users to see the source of specific information directly within the flow of the conversation.
How do inline citations improve the user experience?
Inline citations significantly enhance the user experience by reducing the time needed to find relevant sources. Users no longer have to scroll to the end of the message to verify information. Instead, they can quickly and efficiently check the sources by looking at the numbered citations placed right next to the relevant sentences.
How can users view the sources of information using inline citations?
Users can view the sources of information by simply hovering over the inline number representing the citation.
How does the new inline citations feature differ from the traditional citation method?
The new inline citations feature differs from the traditional method by integrating citations directly into the text of the agent’s response. Traditionally, citations were listed at the end of the message, requiring users to scroll down to see them. The inline method places numbered citations immediately after the sentences that reference them, making it easier for users to verify sources as they read.
Can users still see a list of all sources at the end of the message?
Yes, users can still see a list of all sources at the end of the message if the bot owner chooses to display them that way. The bot owner has full control over how citations are displayed, allowing for flexibility in presentation.
How do inline citations enhance the credibility of agent responses?
Inline citations enhance the credibility of agent responses by visually connecting each citation with the exact sentence it supports.
How can businesses benefit from the new inline citations feature?
Businesses can benefit from the new inline citations feature by making their agents look more modern and providing a better user experience.
What steps are required to enable inline citations in the CustomGPT.ai agent?
To enable inline citations in the CustomGPT.ai agent, users need to go to the agent settings and select the inline citations option under the appropriate dropdown menu.

Writing a compelling resume can be a daunting task, but with the help of ChatGPT, an advanced language model, you can streamline the process and create a standout document. In this post, we’ll explore how to use ChatGPT for resume writing, making the most of its capabilities to craft a professional and impactful resume.
Understanding ChatGPT’s Role in Resume Writing

When it comes to resume writing, ChatGPT can assist you in various ways, from suggesting relevant keywords and phrases to providing guidance on formatting and structure.
Leveraging ChatGPT to Optimize Your Resume Content
Identifying Key Skills and Achievements

ChatGPT can help you identify the most appropriate keywords and phrases to effectively communicate your qualifications. Simply provide ChatGPT with your job history and responsibilities, and it can suggest tailored language to showcase your expertise.
Crafting Compelling Descriptions

About AI Ace
AI Ace’s story starts in October of 2023, when
Leon Niederberger
, a student at IE Business School Madrid, used CustomGPT to program an AI-powered tutor for his macroeconomics midterm. After training it on the course’s content and sharing it with his friends, Leon’s AI tutor spread like wildfire.
Within three days, the tutor had seen and answered 1,750 questions from over 300 students. Ever the entrepreneur, Leon knew he was on to something.
Recruiting fellow student Danil Galkin as his CTO, the pair went straight to work on transforming Leon’s CustomGPT tutor from a small experiment into a full blown business.
AI Ace's Goals
AI Ace was conceptualized with a clear vision – to outperform existing AI chatbots like ChatGPT in educational settings.
Leon and Danil aimed to create a chatbot that not only provided correct answers, but also included citations to professorial resources or textbooks, ensuring a more relevant and reliable learning experience.
"If you want to achieve a similar output with ChatGPT, you will have to research each chapter and copy the format and the deadline into ChatGPT-4. AI Ace will only create questions regarding the midterm topics due to its training on the course content, while ChatGPT searches the internet for related keywords and then, based on this, creates questions. That results in a student studying topics that are not even covered in the midterm!"
Leon Niederberger
Founder, AI Ace
AI Ace's Approach
The development of AI Ace was a meticulous process. Leon and Danil focused on training the bot extensively on textbook content to ensure its proficiency in academic subjects.
They crafted a unique tutor persona for the AI, tailoring its responses to be more student-friendly and educational.
The deployment phase saw AI Ace seamlessly integrating into the student community, quickly becoming an indispensable tool for learning.
AI Ace's Results
AI Ace’s impact was immediate and profound. It demonstrated an unparalleled ability to answer questions more accurately and helpfully than other generative AI solution.
Leon and Danil’s success was not just in user numbers, but also in recognition – AI Ace won the prestigious Best Undergraduate Start-Up award from IE University and secured a valuation of $1.2 million.
This monumental achievement underlined the immense potential of AI in transforming educational experiences.

Ultimately, they hoped to leverage the latest AI technologies to disseminate their vast entrepreneurial knowledge in a natural and highly usable manner.
“For the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, we needed a Generative AI platform that would provide trustworthy responses based on our own data. We chose the CustomGPT solution because of its scalable data ingestion platform which enabled us to bring together knowledge of entrepreneurship across multiple knowledge bases at MIT, and for its accurate responses using the latest ChatGPT technologies, along with a solution to avoid any hallucination problems. The CustomGPT platform has enabled us to create ChatMTC, a generative AI solution for entrepreneurs to easily access knowledge based on the deep entrepreneurship resources available at MIT.”
Doug Williams
Product Lead, Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship
MIT's Approach
The Martin Trust Center needed to ensure that the responses provided by their AI solution were accurate and hallucination-free (that means no made-up responses).
After some research, they found and tested CustomGPT. The team uploaded entrepreneurial knowledge found in various formats, including documents, help desk repositories, and even Youtube videos. They then instructed the AI to act as a one-stop-shop for entrepreneurs to find opportunities, events, resources, classes and connect with the community.
MIT's Results
Despite the behemoth task of compiling their entire entrepreneurial knowledge base, the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship was able to quickly build a secure and anti-hallucinatory AI that immediately answers budding entrepreneurs’ most pressing questions.
Their solution, deemed “ChatMTC”, answers questions for entrepreneurs in a natural and conversational manner utilizing all the knowledge contained across a variety of MIT’s rich entrepreneurship resources. Most importantly, ChatMTC provides accurate responses based solely on MIT’s knowledge base, thanks to CustomGPT’s proprietary anti-hallucination technology.
Now, MTC’s vast knowledge is retrievable right on their homepage, available 24/7, accessible in seconds, and instantly translated across 90+ languages.

How It Works
Enterprise
How is CustomGPT different from other AI chatbots or language models?
CustomGPT is based on your business content. This results in trusted responses based on your business – not generic responses you would see in ChatGPT.
CustomGPT is powered by the same advanced AI language models (LLMs) that power OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4, so you get the latest in AI technology. And since it has ingested your data, it can generate more accurate and relevant responses, without hallucinations – that is, making up facts. This enhances the overall performance and personalization, allowing your business to benefit from improved employee efficiency and customer experience.
As AI technologies continue to advance, we will automatically include the latest AI technology in all CustomGPT chatbots, so you can always benefit from the latest AI technology!

Getting Started
What is CustomGPT and how does it work?
CustomGPT creates your own custom ChatGPT chatbot with all your business content. You then get accurate, trusted ChatGPT responses from your content without making up facts. All within a secure, privacy-first, business-grade platform.
It works by ingesting your data, including your website content, helpdesk, knowledge bases, documents, Youtube videos, podcasts, etc and uses this information to let ChatGPT-4 respond to customer and employee inquiries.
So in short: Anything that you can do with ChatGPT-4 but
with your data
.
The result is a personalized ChatGPT-powered chatbot that is
unique to your business
and understands all the details of your products, services, and customers. With CustomGPT, you can improve your employee efficiency and customer experience with generative AI.
How does CustomGPT use my data to build a custom ChatGPT-type chatbot?
CustomGPT uses your data to build a custom chatbot by ingesting the information you provide into our system.

Our
secure and privacy-preserving
cloud platform then ingests this content and uses this information to respond to queries with ChatGPT.
The result is a Custom ChatGPT-style bot that can have a deep understanding of your business and customers, allowing it to provide personalized and accurate responses,
without hallucinations
, to a wide range of inquiries. This bot can then be embedded into your website, used as a LiveChat or integrated into your systems via the API.
How do I get started with CustomGPT and how do I subscribe to the service?

sign up
for a subscription to our service. After the 2-minute setup, our system will get to work building a custom chatbot trained on your specific content.

, using which CustomGPT can index the entire content of your website and refresh it periodically to check for any new content.

New: You can now also mix-and-match and
add data from  multiple sources
to create a “source of truth” with your chatbot.
Update: We now have a
Zapier
integration so that you can easily ingest content from all your tools and apps.

See
this example
of a branded chatbot.

customize
the logo, background color or image to align with your brand’s visual identity. You can also customize the Chatbot language and default source used by the Chatbot to provide responses.
New: And now,  “Premium”  and “Enterprise” plans can remove the “Powered by CustomGPT” branding for a true while-label / reseller experience.

upload documents
or add
data from multiple sources
to build a consolidated “source of truth” on your competitor
.
Can CustomGPT read and understand tables in PDF files?
CustomGPT does read the text from the tables (in PDF and Excel/CSV files). However, do note: ChatGPT (and CustomGPT) is quite bad at analytics and math. So if your use case is related to counting and analytics, CustomGPT might not be a good choice.
However, anything related to searching for content in the tables and then creating text responses based off that, should work remarkably well.

Unlike many chatbots, it can handle complex queries and provide personalized recommendations. CustomGPT utilizes this advanced technology from ChatGPT and combines it with your unique content to adapt it to your specific business needs.
How It Works
What kind of support and resources does CustomGPT provide for customers?
CustomGPT provides a range of support and resources for its customers. This includes access to our online knowledge base, as well as
email support
from our customer service team.
But wait: We use our own system to provide you with a full knowledge repository for our business. Rather than traditional email, try
asking CustomGPT
using our website widget. Anything you see on the website is now a question away.
Additionally, for enterprise customers, we offer training and onboarding services to help you get the most out of your custom chatbot. We also provide ongoing updates and improvements to our platform to ensure you always have access to the latest technology and information about the same.
Are there any limitations or restrictions to using CustomGPT and chatbot?
The chatbot’s performance and accuracy is impacted by the quality and volume of the data it is trained on, so it’s important to regularly review and update your training data as needed.
Additionally, CustomGPT is a cloud-based subscription platform and there are limitations to the amount of data we ingest (based on your plan) and number of queries your chatbot can handle in any given month, based on your
subscription plan
. Finally, relevant laws and regulations apply, and customers are responsible for ensuring their use of the chatbot is in compliance with these regulations.
How long does it take CustomGPT to ingest my data?
On average, it takes a few minutes to fully index your data.
The exact time it takes will depend on the amount and type of data. File processing is quick (seconds). Website crawling could take longer (minutes or hours depending on the speed and size of your website). Most small business bots build in less than 5 mins.
Is CustomGPT secure and privacy-compliant?
Yes. Your data is fully encrypted and files are stored only when you choose to. Files are encrypted in transit, and encrypted at rest. We use secure vendors like AWS and Stripe. See our full list of
security principles
.
Moreover, your chatbot is fully-self contained, which means it does not share ANY data with other chatbots, even within your own account.
And by default, your chatbot is private, which means only authorized users can query your chatbot. We understand the importance of your data security and privacy and are fully committed to ensure that the chatbot and your data are secure, confidential and private.
Update
: And as of March 1st 2023, OpenAI has
confirmed
that they
do not use your data
for training purposes.  Since we use the ChatGPT API, no parts of your data will be used for training purposes by OpenAI.
What is the customer support like for CustomGPT?
You have two options:
Option 1 (AI)
: Guess what? We’ve built a CustomGPT chatbot with
all our business content
. So if you want to quickly test our system or have questions, use this ChatGPT-style chatbot that knows all our information.
Ask It Anything
!
Option 2 (Human) :
You can use the traditional method and
contact us
. We try to answer all questions (using a real human) in 1-2 business days.
Does OpenAI use my data for training purposes?
As of March 1st 2023, OpenAI has now
clarified
that they
do NOT use data
from API calls in their training. And as we use the ChatGPT-4 API, your data and queries are NOT used in any of their ML training.
Are there any limitations to the output or response length of CustomGPT?
Yes. We use the ChatGPT-4 API which has limits on the response length, so the response for a single user query can be up to about 4500 words.
Can CustomGPT be connected with other platforms such as Microsoft Teams or CRM systems?
CustomGPT API is included in all the plans. You can use the API to query the bot and integrate the chatbot into your existing systems and platforms and even build apps.
UPDATE (August 2023) : We now have a full bi-directional
Zapier
app. You can use it to connect to your tools and apps. Send data to your chatbot and make it smarter and up-to-date. Or query your chatbot from Slack, SMS or other workflows.

I’ve heard of this privacy incident with Samsung. Do I need to be worried?
All data uploaded to a bot stays within that silo. It is not even shared with other bots in the same account. You can see our security principles here: https://customgpt.ai/security/
Also, OpenAI has now clarified that they do not use data from API calls in their training (aka: the infamous Samsung issue!). You can see:
The announcement here:
https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/01/addressing-criticism-openai-will-no-longer-use-customer-data-to-train-its-models-by-default/
OpenAI’s data usage page:
https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies
Can I control the scope of questions users can ask CustomGPT?
It’s not possible to control the text entered by a user in the chatbot, however the responses to the questions can be controlled by the business / organization which has deployed the CustomGPT chatbot.
In fact, CustomGPT takes great pride in providing a rock-solid context boundary around your business content, so that responses are from within your organization’s information. Please see:
https://customgpt.ai/hallucinations/
Can I have the bot behave in a certain way and respond based on my customizations?
Absolutely – this is an excellent new feature called “
Persona
“. This lets you customize how the bot behaves. You can see more details here:
https://customgpt.ai/chatgpt-personas/
Ninja Tip: We create a free tool you can use called “
Make My Custom Instructions
” (And yes – this tool itself was created with CustomGPT using Personas)
How can we be assured our business data will be protected and there are no data breaches?
We take data protection seriously at CustomGPT. Our security measures include strong encryption, access controls, and a robust system architecture designed to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches. For an in-depth understanding of how we ensure data protection, please refer to our security principles at
https://customgpt.ai/security/
. We are committed to regularly updating and improving our security practices to protect your business data effectively.
If you have any questions regarding privacy or security, please review our
comprehensive guide
at :
https://customgpt.ai/security-privacy-guide/
How do I customize the ChatGPT bot using your platform?

This can be used to enhance customer service and knowledge management. Plus, we have an Affiliate Partner Program that allows you to earn money while promoting the use of our platform.
How do AI chatbots for business, especially the ones from CustomGPT, ensure accuracy and relevance?
CustomGPT ensures accuracy and relevance by ingesting your business content and using that information to respond to queries. It’s powered by ChatGPT-4 and CustomGPT’s propreitary anti-hallucination algorithm, which generate accurate and relevant responses without making up facts. We’ve also implemented a context boundary wall that ensures responses are derived solely from your business content, effectively walling out any general or unrelated internet data. This results in trusted responses from your content.
How does the customizable AI feature in CustomGPT enhance user interactions?
The customizable AI feature in CustomGPT enhances user interactions by allowing you to give your chatbot custom instructions that align with your business needs. This can range from engaging a customer to advanced AI techniques like detecting frustration. It helps initiate a call-to-action, facilitates more human-like experiences, distinguishes your brand, and delivers exceptional customer experiences. This feature requires zero coding, making it accessible to every non-technical user.
What steps are involved to make your own AI chatbot using CustomGPT's platform?
To create your own AI chatbot using CustomGPT’s platform, you provide a link to your website or upload files and documents. You can even use both methods. This allows the chatbot to be customized to your specific needs and preferences.

About i4ANeYe
i4ANeYe
is a pioneering enterprise dedicated to unlocking the potential of both organic and artificial general intelligence through the process of Perspective Evolution. Led by visionary founder Matt Belanger, i4ANeYe strives to empower any and all individuals to explore the depths of their own thought processes, exposing the intricacies of how life experiences and conscious principles relate.
Their flagship innovation, the
EPIPHANY Engine
, represents the next evolution of the search engine. Through the Universal Axiom, the EPIPHANY Engine allows you to dissect and analyze your impulses, elements, and pressure. i4ANeYe is dedicated to the concept of “Conscious Physics” and aims to redefine the way information is explored and processed.
i4ANeYe’s Goals
The primary goal for i4ANeYe was to develop a novel foundational AI core model, capable of processing information in a unique, nature-inspired way. With industry giants like Bloomberg demonstrating just how much bespoke AI development can cost, i4ANeYe faced the challenge of creating an inexpensive and innovative solution without the luxury of massive funding. Their objective was to build a prototype that could attract investor interest, demonstrating both the functionality and potential of their AI model.
To make the EPIPHANY Engine a reality, i4ANeYe had two options: 1. They could eat the cost and build their own LLM or 2. They could use an existing, low-code solution to build a low-cost prototype.
“Using CustomGPT’s unique platform was a game-changer for i4ANeYe. But what truly set it apart for us was the Persona feature. It allowed us to tailor the AI, ensuring it aligned seamlessly with our vision and the intricacies of the Epiphany Engine. Building our prototype was not just faster but more intuitive, capturing the essence of our brand and the depth of our insights.”
Matt Belanger
Founder, i4ANeYe
i4ANeYe’s Approach
While CustomGPT’s robust data integration features allowed i4ANeYe to integrate various data sources into their AI model, the most influential feature by far was the customizable “Persona”. Meticulously customizing and tweaking the Persona was crucial for i4ANeYe, as it enabled the development of a prototype that aligned with their vision (such as integrating the principles of Conscious Physics and Perspective Evolution).
Further, CustomGPT’s anti-hallucination protocols ensured that the AI responses were tethered to factual information – critical for guaranteeing that the EPIPHANY Engine provides accurate and reliable introspective analysis and processing of information, all the time.
The no-code aspect of CustomGPT gave i4ANeYe the ability to quickly prototype and iterate the EPIPHANY proof of concept, allowing them to develop a minimum viable product ready to show off to potential investors.
i4ANeYe’s Results
By leveraging the Persona feature, Matt Belanger and i4ANeYe rapidly and effectively developed a chatbot prototype that went beyond basic functionality to truly resonate with users. This resonance sent ripples through the community, extending far beyond the initial audience, and captured the attention of the investment community.
The investor interest was immediate and significant, aided by i4ANeYe’s ability to put out a time- and cost-effective AI model. The accurate, context-specific responses, not only highlighted the prototype’s immediate capabilities but also illuminated its immense potential for practical, real-world applications. The result? At the time of this writing, i4ANeYe is on the brink of securing a substantial funding deal.
In a competitive startup environment, where capturing investor interest and securing funding is a formidable challenge, the ability to swiftly transform a concept into an impressive and tangible prototype is invaluable.

Elizabeth's Goals
Elizabeth wanted to make her extensive library of resources more accessible and interactive for organizations in the nonprofit sector. She needed a way to share her knowledge without overwhelming users with too much dense information, and was looking for an AI-driven solution that could facilitate easy access and engagement with her materials.
“You can rely on the responses it gives you because its only pulling from [curated] information.”
Elizabeth Planet
Nonprofit Leadership Coach and Advisor, nonprofitama.com​
Elizabeth's Approach
Initially, Elizabeth experimented with various tools, but faced challenges due to their overly complex and technical interfaces. She eventually discovered CustomGPT, which not only seemed well-suited for accessing and sharing her archive of information, but also required little to no technical knowledge to use. She easily uploaded a significant number of PDFs and resources, training the AI on her own data. Most importantly, Elizabeth also incorporated sitemaps from top nonprofit resources to supercharge the AI’s nonprofit-specific knowledge base.
Elizabeth's Results
When everything was said and done, Elizabeth had created a user-friendly, public-facing, and free-to-use tool, specifically tailored to the nonprofit sector. Deemed “NonprofitAMA”, her CustomGPT-powered tool allows users to interact with a vast array of nonprofit resources and information. It consistently provides accurate, reliable responses along with citations to its many sources. Building an AI chatbot with CustomGPT has allowed her to share poignant educational resources, thus empowering those in the nonprofit sector with constant and instant access to reliable information.

About NITRO! Bootcamp
NITRO! Bootcamp
, presented by
Cintrifuse
, is a program focused on educating and empowering underserved minority and women-owned small business owners. Scheduled for November 18th, 2023, the bootcamp’s main goal is to teach participants how to use technology to scale and sustain their businesses. The curriculum covers a range of topics, including generative AI, digital platform optimization, and alternative funding sources. The program is committed to driving economic growth and innovation in the Greater Cincinnati region. For more information, visit the
NITRO! Bootcamp website
.
NITRO! Bootcamp's Goals
On top of providing business owners with access to and classes on how to take advantage of popular business software services like Canva, Wix, and Cyfe, NITRO! looked to CustomGPT to teach and provide the participants with a generative AI solution that they could take advantage of immediately. Neither NITRO! nor CustomGPT had attempted this before, so their objective was to forge a new path to AI-Success in a “bootcamp” setting. Ninety minutes was set aside at the end of the event for all thirty business owners to gather around and learn how they could build AI chatbots using their unique company information.
As such, NITRO! and CustomGPT had a question to answer: How the heck were they going to set up over thirty businesses with about sixty chatbots in the span of an hour and a half?
“Amari Samya, owner of SelfieCincy, volunteered for an in-person demonstration of CustomGPT. The workshop facilitator, Christopher Brock, used this tool to scan her business’ website and rewrite the copy with SEO-tailored keywords. He then sent the revised copy to her. The process took about 5 minutes.”
Miyah Byrd
Writer, Soapbox Media
NITRO! Bootcamp's Approach
By working closely with all thirty of the businesses, CustomGPT and NITRO! created an “AI Developers Kit” customized to the needs of each of the participating businesses. This Dev. Kit was filled with a myriad of useful guides, tips, and resources that would help each business owner get the most out of CustomGPT, both during the initial training session, and beyond the conclusion of the bootcamp.
Each business was provided with a sitemap of their website, a custom “Growth Assistant” Persona (developed using the unique specifications of their businesses), as well as a “Customer Service” prototype Persona (which they could adjust to meet their specific needs). The Kit was also accompanied by “Prompting Tips for Growth” derived from NITRO!’s model and framework for business growth.
NITRO! Bootcamp's Results
When all was said and done, every single business present was able to use the AI Developer Kit to create multiple instances of their own, custom AI-powered chatbots. Most businesses took advantage of both the “Customer Service Agent” and “Growth Assistant” Personas, and some even created a third Persona catered to their use case (for example, one business created a chatbot that writes custom DALL-E prompts based on their unique business information). A particularly interesting use case emerged when one business owner (a publisher) had the idea to use the personality of one of his book’s characters as inspiration for his chatbot’s personality and attitude.
The NITRO! participants will reconvene a few months into 2024 to discuss the ways that their new business software, including CustomGPT, has positioned them to achieve high growth going into the future.
